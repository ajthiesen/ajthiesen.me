Halpatter Tustenuggee (Alligator), born about 1795, was about five feet tall but well proportioned. According to John K. Mahon, “He was a natural comedian, evoking a laugh even in solemn councils. Yet in dealing with white men he acted as if born to the purple. His manners, in all respects, were as fine as theirs. Behind his open face and Roman nose was a stock of shrewdness, craft, and intelligence second to none.” Alligator, with about 120 warriors, fought against the U. S. Army under Zachary Taylor at Lake Okeechobee on December 25, 1837, where 26 whites were killed and 112 wounded, and 11 Seminoles were killed and 14 wounded.

# The Treaty of Payne’s Prairie was confirmed 

## Date in History: 

28 Mar 1833

1833 - The Treaty of Payne’s Prairie was confirmed on this date with the signing of the Treaty of Fort Gibson.  Seminoles agreed to the removal of the Seminole people from Florida in the Treaty of Fort Gibson, Arkansas, after their investigation of the new western lands.  Removal would take place within three years. Chief Charley-E-Mather agreed to the removal.  Not all Seminole leaders agreed with this, and on their return to Florida announced that they had only agreed that the lands in Arkansas were satisfactory.  Arpeika (Sam Jones), Jumper, Black Dirt, and Halpatter-Tustenuggee (Alligator) were opposed. The Treaty of Payne’s Landing was ratified by the U.S. Senate April 12th, 1834, and signed on May 9th, 1832 while a second treaty was signed on March 28, 1833 at Fort Gibson after seven Seminole delegates inspected the lands being offered to ousted tribes during relocation.  This Fort Gibson Treaty stated that Seminoles would live on Creek land after surrendering Seminole lands to the U.S. government.  Provisions from the first treaty included food, land, and a shirt and blanket for each member as compensation for Western cold climate.

Seminole Perspective:  
Account of the attack by Halpatter-Tustenuggee or Alligator  
![](http://johnhorse.com/graphics/dotgr.gif)[Back to main trail](http://johnhorse.com/trail/02/b/12.htm)

Almost all accounts of the war come from white observers, making this testimony by the prominent chief Halpatter-Tustenuggee, or Alligator, especially interesting. Quite possibly, the officer who recorded the testimony colored it with his own choice of diction or other omissions and embellishments. Contrast, for example, the graphic emphasis placed on the description of an American bashing out the brains of an Indian, versus the terse account of negroes killing three soldiers.  
  
_Account of the attack on Dade's men by Halpatter-Tustenuggee or Alligator, as recorded in Sprague's 1848 history:_

"We had ... been preparing for this more than a year. Though promises had been made to assemble on the 1st of January, it was not to leave the country, but to fight for it. In council, it was determined to strike a decided blow about this time. Our agent at Fort King had put irons on our men and said we must go. Oseola said he was his friend, he would see to him. It was determined that he should attack Fort King, in order to reach General Thompson, then return to the Wahoo Swamp, and participate in the assault meditated upon the soldiers coming from Fort Brooke, as the negroes there had reported that two companies were preparing to march. He was detained longer than we anticipated. The troops were three days on their march, and approaching the Swamp. Here we thought it best to assail them; and should we be defeated the Swamp would be a safe place of retreat. Our scouts were out from the time the soldiers left the post, and reported each night their place of encampment. It was our intention to attack them on the third night, but the absence of Micanopy and Oseola prevented it. On the arrival of the latter it was agreed not to wait for Oseola, as the favorable moment would pass. Micanopy was timid, and urged delay. Jumper earnestly opposed it, and reproached the old chief for his indecision. He addressed the Indians, and requested those who had faint hearts to remain behind; he was going, when Micanopy said he was ready. Just as day was breaking we moved out of the swamp into the pine-barren. I counted, by direction of Jumper, one hundred and eight warriors. Upon approaching the road, each man chose his position on the west side; opposite, on the east side, there was a pond. Every warrior was protected by a tree, or secreted in the high palmettoes. About nine o'clock in the morning the command approached. In advance, some distance, was an officer on a horse, who, Micanopy said, was the captain; he knew him personally; had been his friend at Tampa. So soon as all the soldiers were opposite, between us and the pond, perhaps twenty yards off, Jumper gave the whoop. Micanopy fired the first rifle, the signal agreed upon, when every Indian arose and fired, which laid upon the ground, dead, more than half the white men. The cannon was discharged several times, but the men who loaded it were shot down as soon as the smoke cleared away. The soldiers shouted and whooped, and the officers shook their swords and swore. There was a little man, a great brave, who shook his sword at the soldiers and said, 'God-damn!' no rifle ball could hit him. As we were returning to the swamp, supposing all were dead, an Indian came up and said the white men were building a fort of logs. Jumper and myself, with ten warriors, returned. As we approached, we saw six men behind two logs placed one above another, with the cannon a short distance off. This they discharged at us several times, but we avoided it by dodging behind the trees just as they applied the fire. We soon came near, as the balls went over us. They had guns, but no powder; we looked in the boxes afterwards and found they were empty. When I got inside the logpen, there were three white men alive, whom the negroes put to death, after a conversation in English. There was a brave man in the pen; he would not give up; he seized an Indian, Jumper's cousin, took away his rifle, and with one blow with it beat out his brains, then ran some distance up the road; but two Indians on horseback overtook him, who, afraid to approach, stood at a distance and shot him down. The firing had ceased, and all was quiet when we returned to the swamp about noon. We left many negroes upon the ground looking at the dead men. Three warriors were killed and five wounded."
