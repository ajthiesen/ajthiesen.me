History is a tricky subject to grasp. As the famous saying goes, "history is written by the victors." This quote has been attributed to multiple individuals, including Winston Churchill, a Nazi war criminal, and a Confederate congressman. It's hard to get a clear understanding of what really happened.

That's why I've created this Substack with two distinct parts: the analytical and cultural sides. The analytical side is slightly easier to explain, thanks to the abundance of scholarly resources available online. We'll cover pre-Colombian history from the appearance of paleo Indians on the Florida peninsula around 12,000 years ago to Juan Ponce de León's "discovery" of Florida in 1513.

However, when it comes to the history of the North American continent as a whole, things become even more complex. The continent is estimated to be around 4.5 billion years old, with the oldest rocks found in North America being around 4 billion years old. That's a staggering amount of time!

To put things into perspective, imagine a football field representing the entire history of the Earth. The first humans would appear in the very last inch of the field, with all of recorded human history occupying only a tiny fraction of that last inch.

While written language is generally considered a cornerstone of civilization, there's still an enormous amount of unrecorded, undocumented history that we know very little about. To advance the concepts of humanoid evolution, migration, and settlement patterns, some creative license may need to be taken, although it's generally best to avoid a fictional approach to research and analysis.

Moving on to the cultural side of history, this Substack focuses on the Seminole and Micosukee tribes in Florida. These two distinct tribes have their own unique views on identity, race, language, culture, warfare, justice, and politics. It's essential to acknowledge that each tribe has its own distinct culture, and reducing either of them to the same identity as the other would be disrespectful to both the tribe and its members.

To illustrate this point, imagine two individuals of similar build and appearance, one from Reno, Nevada, and the other from Copenhagen, Denmark. Although they may share some biological similarities, their cultural differences are as vast as the ocean.

Now, let's talk about what's coming next. The next posts will leverage some creative license to set the groundwork for a paleo-Indian migration from what is now the Ural/Caucasian mountains in Russia, across the Bering Land Bridge, through Alaska and Canada, down into the southern parts of the American state of Georgia.

I’m going to fast forward by around 11,500 years. The next chapters will focus on a paleo-Indian named Tala, his family unit, and their migration to eventually transition the history of the Americas, the Seminole and Indian Wars, Andrew Jackson, Fidel Castro, and the current states of the Seminole and Miccosukee tribes.

Join me as we delve deeper into the fascinating history and cultures of these tribes, and explore the mysteries and complexities of North American history.
