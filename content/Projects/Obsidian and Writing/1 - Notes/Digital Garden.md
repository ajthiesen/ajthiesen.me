A digital garden is a personal knowledge management system that is designed to help people nurture, cultivate and share their ideas, thoughts, and notes in an organized and interconnected way. It's different from other note-taking or writing tools because it focuses on connecting ideas together. 

Instead of organizing notes in a linear way, a digital garden uses hypertext links to connect related ideas, allowing for a more dynamic and organic way of organizing information. This helps the creator to discover patterns and connections between different ideas. 

Digital gardens can be built on personal websites and come in many forms, from simple collections of Markdown files to more sophisticated systems built with specialized tools or platforms. People may also opt to share their digital gardens publicly, as a way to share their ideas with others and to invite collaboration and feedback.
