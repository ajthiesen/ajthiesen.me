> We fear solitude, but itâ€™s exactly this time alone with our own thoughts that we need to make sense of our experiences and grow as humans. TikTok is fun, but grappling with the core questions of our existence is fundamental.

It's true that many people find it uncomfortable or even frightening to be alone with their own thoughts, especially in a world that often encourages constant stimulation and distraction. However, taking time to reflect on our experiences and contemplate the bigger questions of life can be incredibly valuable for personal growth and development.

When we are alone with our thoughts, we have the opportunity to reflect on our experiences, process our emotions, and gain a deeper understanding of ourselves and the world around us. This can help us make more informed decisions, develop greater self-awareness, and become more resilient in the face of challenges.

On the other hand, constantly [[seeking distraction]] and [[avoiding solitude]] can prevent us from truly confronting the deeper questions of our existence. While social media platforms like TikTok can be entertaining and even informative, they often provide only surface-level engagement with ideas and experiences, and may even serve as a way to avoid uncomfortable feelings or thoughts.

Ultimately, it's important to find a balance between staying connected with others and taking time for introspection and self-reflection. By engaging with our own thoughts and exploring the core questions of our existence, we can gain a deeper appreciation for life and develop a greater sense of purpose and meaning.
