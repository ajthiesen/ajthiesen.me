Whole food, plant based corn chowder! This chowder can be as thick and creamy as you like, depending on how much of the soup you puree. 

**Ingredients**  
¼ cup water  
1 yellow onion, chopped  
2 celery stalks, chopped  
2 russet potatoes, diced  
¼ cup nutritional yeast  
½ tsp smoked paprika  
½ tsp dried thyme  
¼ tsp ground black pepper  
4 cups Light Vegetable Broth  
1 pound corn kernels, fresh or thawed from frozen  
2 tsp white miso paste  
2 tsp fresh lemon juice  
1 tbsp fresh parsley, minced 

**Directions**

1.  Heat ¼ cup of water in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion, celery, and potatoes. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes, or until softened. Stir in the nutritional yeast, paprika, thyme, black pepper, and Light Vegetable Broth. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat to low, stir in the corn, and simmer for 20 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender. 
    
2.  Scoop 2 cups of the soup solids into a high-powdered blender, add the miso paste, and blend until smooth. Stir the pureed mixture back into the soup. Add the lemon juice, then taste and adjust the seasonings, if needed. If you prefer a thicker chowder, puree another cup of soup solids and add it back to the pot. Heat the soup until hot and serve sprinkled with parsley.
