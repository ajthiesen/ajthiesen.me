-   2 teaspoons instant coffee granules
-   2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Steps

1.  Preheat oven to 350°F. Cut chocolate into small pieces (1 1/2 cups). Line 8-inch square baking pan with foil, allowing foil to extend over edges of pan. Place 1/2 cup chocolate pieces in microwave-safe bowl; microwave on MEDIUM for 45–65 seconds, stirring hallway, or until melted. Stir until mixture is smooth.
2.  Rinse and drain black beans. Place black beans, oil, eggs, sugar, and cocoa powder in food processor bowl; process 1 minute or until blended and smooth. Add flour, baking powder, coffee granules, vanilla, salt, and melted chocolate; process until smooth. Remove blade; stir in 1/2 cup chocolate pieces.
3.  Spread batter into baking pan; sprinkle top with remaining 1/2 cup chocolate pieces. Bake 20–25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in center comes out with just a few moist crumbs.
4.  Transfer to wire rack to cool for 30 minutes. Use foil to lift brownies from pan. Top brownies with whipped topping (if desired); serve.
