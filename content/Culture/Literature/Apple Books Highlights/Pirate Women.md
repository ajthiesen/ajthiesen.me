## Highlights
Pirates live outside the laws of man, but women pirates live outside the laws of nature.

They have been called raiders, sea dogs, buccaneers, freebooters, corsairs, bandits, and many other names in many languages. 

---
The nature of piracy is such that it is difficult to separate fact and fiction because pirates were, by necessity, not frequently a part of historical record.
