## Highlights

> Restrictions aren’t limited to book titles. Maps, survival guides, and even specific magazine issues (of _Reader’s Digest_ and _Rolling Stone_, among others) are prohibited. Restrictions vary from state to state, facility to facility.

And they succeed in doing so without much public awareness or oversight.
