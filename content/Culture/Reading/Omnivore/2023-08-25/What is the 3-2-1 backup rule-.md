## Highlights

> The 3-2-1 Rule is a rule to live by. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/what-is-the-3-2-1-backup-rule-18a2dc74d2e#15682369-41c1-4f72-8540-b7916215d4d6)  ^15682369

> The 3-2-1 Rule, as I like to explain it, states the following:
> There should be 3 copies of data
> On 2 different media
> With 1 copy being off-site [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/what-is-the-3-2-1-backup-rule-18a2dc74d2e#7a2192d0-8118-4b54-8875-2dbf351d3c93)  ^7a2192d0

> This is very versatile nowadays and each of the following implementations would count towards a 3-2-1 Rule configuration:
> Backups on disk (DAS, SAN, NAS and appliances)
> Backups on tape
> Backups on removable storage
> Storage snapshots (caution on separate media from production)
> Backups in object storage such as in the public cloud with the Scale-out Backup Repository’s capacity tier
> Backups in cold archive storage in the public cloud with the Scale-out Backup Repository’s archive tier
> Backups hosted or managed by a service provider, including Veeam Cloud Connect
> Replication to another host or site with Veeam replication
> Backup copy jobs to another storage location [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/what-is-the-3-2-1-backup-rule-18a2dc74d2e#fdcc4c31-7dbd-4819-aa7d-c2608cc6b1b0)  ^fdcc4c31
