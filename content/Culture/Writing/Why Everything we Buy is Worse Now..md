**Thought:**
> the problem is *us*. For decades, we've been conditioned to buy, buy, buy, and today it's normal for many consumers to shop for new clothes at least once a month. In order to keep up, many companies have to prioritize making things in the fastest and least expensive way possible. To do that, they cut corners with materials and labor. In turn, quality suffers, which leaves consumers with a lot of crappy things.
