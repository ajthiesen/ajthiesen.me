#### ADHD Tips For More Efficient Work

-   Avoid multitasking and try to stay focused on one task at a time.
-   Use reminder calendars and to-do lists 
-   Break down your task into smaller tasks

-   Do not give yourself a big project to finish in a small time frame. No one is able to do that. Give yourself extra time to finish it.
-   If you are prone to losing files and papers that are necessary for tasks use cloud computing to scan all paperwork to digital formats, then organize them into projects naming them by date and create a list of all the files.
