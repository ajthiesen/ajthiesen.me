I have a problem with #focus.  Im pretty sure (and am in the process of being diagnosed) that I have #ADHD. This however is only a cause of my lack of focus, and not a #symptom. 

My main symptom is that I find some *thing*:
- article
- link
- tutorial 
- book

Make a note of it, in one of my many (former) #PKM tools and promptly forget all about it until a few months later when I find it searching for something else and get distracted by it again. 

**These** thoughts/notes/ideas in #Obsidian are #focused and have #intent. As I read something or have a thought they go into #Obsidian and the. They have #thought and #intention behind them. 

What does that mean? It means that I consume something. Make notes about it and then reflect on it to attempt to #retain more of the content.
