## How Hide My [[Email]] works

Hide My [[Email]] generates unique, random [[Email]] addresses that automatically forward to your personal inbox. Each address is unique to you. You can read and respond directly to emails sent to these addresses and your personal [[Email]] address is kept private.

-   If you create an account with an app or visit a website that supports Sign in with Apple, you can choose to share your [[Email]] address, if you're familiar with the app or website, or hide your [[Email]] address, if you'd prefer more privacy. If you choose the Hide my [[Email]] option, only the app or website you created the account with can use this random [[Email]] address to communicate with you. [Learn more about Sign in with Apple](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT210318). 
-   With an iCloud+ subscription, you can generate unique, random addresses from your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch with iOS 15 or iPadOS 15 or later in any [[Email]] field in Safari. You can also generate [[Email]] addresses on-demand in the Settings app or on [iCloud.com](https://icloud.com/). [Learn more about iCloud+](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201318). 

Apple doesn't read or process any of the content in the [[Email]] messages that pass through Hide My [[Email]], except to perform standard spam filtering that's required to maintain our status as a trusted [[Email]] provider. All [[Email]] messages are deleted from our relay servers after they're delivered to you, usually within seconds.

At any time, you can change the [[Email]] address that receives forwarded messages. Or you can choose to turn off [[Email]] forwarding to stop receiving messages. You can manage your addresses created with Hide My Email in Settings on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, or on [iCloud.com](https://icloud.com/).
