I’m doing this one a little different. Instead of word counting I am doing a timer based writing. I set a timer for 10 minutes and this is everything in my head and thoughts about *breaks*. 

Everyone needs a break. I don’t mean specifically but in general. 

Between work, kids, meetings, Zoom meetings, conference calls text messages, calendar alerts, tweet notifications, [[Email]] notifications, alarms, we are being overloaded. 

Even being laid off, the pace increases, **not decreased.** Sign exit paperwork, pack up all the hardware, drive to the UPS store to ship it back to company. 

I only have the one child that lives with my wife and I. I can’t imagine how people with more then one child manage things.

I would love to have a little spot in my yard, where I can put up a #hammock, walk outside on a Saturday or Saturday afternoon maybe with a beer or a mixed drink, lay in my hammock, take a little nap and have a feeling of calm and content. 

Could I probably do that sooner, rather then later. Yeah, probably. I was going to write ‘buy’ here, however I can’t think of a good reason why I can’t or shouldn’t be able to do this in the near future. 

I know what the *ideal* setup would look like, but since I am renting right now, I’ll take an OK setup over an ideal setup. 

The point here being that everyone needs to take a break. I know it sounds unrealistic but just try. Go get coffee and just watch the traffic or the people or the birds. Or read a book. Or just ate off to space and daydream!
