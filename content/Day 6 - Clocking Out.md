Ever since I was #laid-off last week I have been working a #contract job while I figure out whatâ€™s next. 

Itâ€™s possibly the ~~best~~ smartest thing I have ever done. Themis week has all been #training. The day starts at 0930. Morning break for fifteen minutes. Half-hour lunch break, between noon and one. More training until about three. Another quick break, the training agin until five thirty in the evening. No #Teams or #Slack messages while Iâ€™m making dinner with my wife. No emails with ridiculous requests or stupid questions while weâ€™re eating dinner. No pings. No nothing. Itâ€™s almost, relaxing. I have a fixed start and end time. There pretty much no overtime. Itâ€™s remote. They sent me everything I need: laptop, monitor. headset, etc.  Pay is decent. Not amazing but certainly not horrible either. The training isnâ€™t even all the boring. The trainer is on top of things. Thereâ€™s a number of little exercises we do throughout the day to learn the product. Iâ€™m kind ofâ€¦.#happy. Iâ€™m still interviewing for a something permanent. I withdrew one application already: [[Withdrawal from a Company]]. 

Itâ€™s nice to clock out, and be done for the day and not have to think about work or feel like itâ€™s looming over me like the other place was. Iâ€™m even sleeping better. ðŸ™ƒ. 

Thereâ€™s something to be said for having a #life and #schedule.
