Indian disturbances in Florida.-The papers received by us, last evening, from New-Orleans, contain accounts of serious disturbances having broken out among the Seminole Indians, who, it appears, are opposed to removing, and have committed several depredations on the inhabitants. On the 19th ult. they attacked a company of volunteers, under Capt. McLemore, at Payne’s Prairie, and succeeded in taking all the baggage, killing four men and wounding eight or ten more. On the following day, they were overtaken by another company of volunteers, who surrounded and nearly destroyed the whole party, with the loss of one killed and 3 wounded. A letter from Head-quarters at Mickanopy, dated 21stult., says-“The whole country in this quarter is ruined-the houses in ashes-the women and children in forts, and the men under arms.”
