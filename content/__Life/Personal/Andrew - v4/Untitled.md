Hi Brian!

Hope you're doing great and gearing up for an amazing weekend! I just wanted to drop you a quick note to follow up on my recent interview for the Technical Account Manager role with Sense.

I'm excited about this opportunity and would love to hear your thoughts on how it went. Additionally, I was wondering if there are any next steps in the process that I should be aware of or any additional information you need from me?

Thanks so much for your time and consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you soon!

Best regards,
