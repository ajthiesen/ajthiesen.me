Ingredients:

-   4 cups of all-purpose flour
-   1/2 cup of sugar
-   1/2 teaspoon of salt
-   1 tablespoon of dry yeast
-   1/2 cup of warm milk
-   4 eggs
-   1/2 cup of unsalted butter, softened
-   Zest of 1 orange
-   1 teaspoon of orange blossom water (optional)
-   1 egg yolk
-   2 tablespoons of sugar

Instructions:

1.  In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, and salt.
    
2.  In a separate small bowl, mix the yeast and warm milk together and let sit for 5 minutes until the mixture becomes frothy.
    
3.  Add the yeast mixture, eggs, butter, orange zest, and orange blossom water (if using) to the dry ingredients and mix until a smooth dough forms.
    
4.  Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for 10-15 minutes until the dough becomes smooth and elastic.
    
5.  Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp towel, and let it rise in a warm, draft-free place for 1 hour.
    
6.  Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).
    
7.  Divide the dough into 4 equal parts and shape each into a round ball.
    
8.  Take a small portion of the dough from each ball and shape it into bone shapes. Place them on top of the bread dough, forming a cross.
    
9.  Place the dough balls on a lightly greased baking sheet and let them rise for an additional 30 minutes.
    
10.  Brush the tops of the dough with the egg yolk and sprinkle the sugar over the top.
    
11.  Bake for 25-30 minutes, until the bread is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.
    
12.  Let the bread cool on a wire rack before serving.
