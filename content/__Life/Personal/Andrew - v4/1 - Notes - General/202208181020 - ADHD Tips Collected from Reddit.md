> **ðŸŒŸ My Favourite:**Â Enjoy the journey more than the destination, donâ€™t be in a hurry to finish something you are doing, but always at least do something small everyday. Life is not a race, rather, it is an accumulation of smaller improvements to oneself. ~Â **(**[u/ksettle](https://www.reddit.com/u/ksettle/)**)**

-   Create a second brain for yourself - in whatever way is most appealing to you. (I personally use Notion) ~Â ([u/significanttoday](https://www.reddit.com/u/significanttoday/)**)**

-   Set a time to do work, and a time to relax; that way you donâ€™t feel guilty about relaxing during the time you set aside for yourself. ~Â **(**[u/talking_face](https://www.reddit.com/u/talking_face/)**)**
