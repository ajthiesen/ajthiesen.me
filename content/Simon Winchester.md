The first [[Simon Winchester]] book I discovered was [[Krakatoa]]. Quite by accident. However, it was not the first time I had heard of [[Simon Winchester]]  I had actually purchased another of his books that was on sale in [[Apple Books]] called [[The Men Who United the States]] but had not begun to read it yet.
