With that as a basis, here are some of the approaches I’ve tried

Without any particular goal in mind, read through the official docs (preferably, a Getting Started guide). Poke away at whatever catches your fancy.

Search for some generic tutorials. Pick one and follow along, doing the exercises, if any.

Search for books on the topic. Pick one and follow along, doing any exercises along the way.

Start with an end goal of what you want to accomplish. A todo app, a program to do X, a CRUD webpage with a Postgres backend etc. Search for tutorials to do that, picking up whatever associated/background knowledge needed to accomplish the task. 

Maintain a list of topics to follow up on some later date.
Similar to the above, start with a book but skim read in order to accomplish the end-goal as quickly as possible.

Redo a familiar, “right sized”, previous project in the new language.

For me, it takes a conscious act of will to stop shuttling between these approaches after some initial messing around and pick just one to pursue further.
