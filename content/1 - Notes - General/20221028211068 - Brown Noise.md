## What Is Brown Noise?

White, pink and brown noises are all different forms of  “sonic hues.” Brown noise is considered a layered sonic hue that has a sound like a low roar.

-   All sound waves can be broken down into frequency, which is how fast the waveform is vibrating per second (one hertz is one vibration per second), and amplitude (sometimes measured as “power”).
-   [W](https://draxe.com/health/white-noise/)[hite noise](https://draxe.com/health/white-noise/) has equal power across all frequencies audible to the human ear,” [according](https://www.soundofsleep.com/2017/07/18/white-pink-brown-noise-whats-difference/) to the Sound of Sleep website. It includes low-, midrange- and high-frequency sounds. 
-   Pink noise _is_ white noise but with reduced higher frequencies.
-   Brown noise lowers the higher frequencies even more.

What is an example of brown noise? Examples in nature include the sound of a strong river current, strong wind, waterfall, thunder or heavy rainfall.

The term brown noise originated in the 1800s. [Also called](https://www.mediacollege.com/audio/noise/brown-noise.html) Brownian noise (or sometimes red noise), it was named after the botanist Robert Brown, who discovered “Brownian motion” (random particle motion).

Researchers have uncovered that the power of brown noise decreases as its frequency increases. This type of noise can be produced by integrating white noise and adding a random offset to each sample to obtain the next one.
