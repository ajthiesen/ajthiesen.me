CAREER GROWTH

	•	follow the money, see where VC investment is going.
	•	Become a subject matter expert in a topic that is both highly funded by VC for the next 5 to 10 years and is currently lacking in expertise
	•	Keep your LinkedIn page updated Ilike a resume. Use technical keywords to describe your role, under each job you’ve held, for search optimization
	•	No need to post socially on LinkedIn, but read other people’s posts. If someone seems to be an expert in your desired field, send them a message telling them you found their post interesting and ask them a follow up question if they’re willing to chat! You can learn so much.
	•	If you form these connections, also ask what expertise their company is looking for and having trouble finding. This will let you feel out the high-demand low-supply roles that pay top dollar, and choose your next field of study
	•	Gain expertise in a niche subject so you can be paid for what you know, not how long you labor. Nobody has to know if it takes you 5 minutes or 5 days to find an answer to a question ;)

JOB SEARCH AND INTERVIEWS

	•	Have a LinkedIn and keep your status constantly open to work. Recruiters will come to you.
	•	Don’t work with recruiters from recruiting agencies, only deal with companies internal recruiters. Agencies take a cut of your salary so you’ll be underpaid if you go this route
	•	Always be interviewing, especially when you’re happy at your job. If you’re interviewing when you’re desperate, you’ll take anything. If you’re interviewing when you’re content, they’ll have to convince you to join.
	•	Never accept a job offer without reference checking the company back. Find 4-6 ex-employees on LinkedIn or in your social network and message them asking if they’re willing to talk about their experiences there, as you’re considering an offer. You’ll get the red flags firsthand and be able to make an informed decision. And it’s the greenest of green flags if even ex employees speak highly of a job.
	•	If you play it right you can also get the ex employees’ opinion on the salary you’re being offered and how much you can push in negotiations.
	•	Don’t ever sign a non-compete if you can help it. If you do have to, try to negotiate it down to months instead of years, and make sure you have the savings to be out of work for that amount of time. Also understand it can be harder to land a new job if you have to tell them you can’t start as soon.
	•	Salary isn’t the only thing you can negotiate on, PTO, remote work, relocation benefits, and more are also on the table. Prioritize what matters most to you!
	•	If you’re leaving one job for another, and you can afford to, try to get some time between jobs for a vacation or rest instead of starting right away!
	•	If it’s pay-to-play, that’s not a job, that’s a scam
	•	Never give notice at a job you’re leaving for another, until you have a signed offer letter in hand, with a start date set.
	•	When you are leaving a job for another, they might ask you if you’d consider a retention offer. Always say yes, but never accept it. If it’s generous, you can use it to negotiate higher pay at your new job.

PERSONALITY / SOFT SKILLS

	•	Even in a highly technical role, don’t discount soft skills. Technically skilled people are common, but technically skilled people who can work well with a team, work through disagreements, and take on a client facing role when needed are less so!
	•	Be friendly to everyone, do people small favors when you’re able, whether they’re senior to you, junior, or not even in your current field of work
	•	Give people genuine compliments with no expectations. The no expectations is important, people can tell when you’re angling for something. Just put good energy out into the world, and trust it will return when you least expect it.
	•	Follow through on your commitments. If you promise to meet a deadline, make it a point to be done by then or earlier. Set reasonable deadlines that leave room for error, if your boss routinely pushes back, it might be time to move along…
	•	Own up to your mistakes, but frame it so so you come across as honest and proactive, instead of like a total fuckup. Like “I’m sorry, I (messed up in this way), I understand (the way it inconvenienced you or damage it caused), and I’m (making these changes to ensure it doesn’t happen again). Then follow through with your promises.
	•	When you become more senior, if junior employees seek mentorship or advice, give them some time! Having a successful team around you makes work go way better, and it’s always worth the upfront cost. And they’ll remember you and speak well of you
	•	Learn to recognize when you or your peers being treated unfairly or inequitably. And learn to really believe you and others deserve better. Reading up on labor rights, and going to therapy personally helped me know when shit’s fucked, and have the self confidence to say I deserve better.

CURRENT JOB

	•	Treat your performance reviews as very important. Set up goals you plan to achieve, and that support your career or education with or without the company. When you achieve them, persuasively tell your manager how you feel you’ve exceeded expectations. (Performance reviews are very linked to pay and job stability)
	•	Advocate for yourself at every chance. Ask for raises.
	•	Don’t take a management role / promotion without fully understanding the additional responsibility and time commitment it entails. And getting a pay increase to compensate
	•	Make your company take on all professional liability… Or get some damn good insurance
	•	Treat your job like a continuation of school. Always be looking for things to learn, and if you find yourself doing repetitive tasks without learning anything new, address that with your manager. Your interest in gaining new skills will impress them and benefit you. Bonus points if you can learn the ‘big money’ skills mentioned above on company time.
	•	Keep notes on everything you do. This is great for retaining knowledge, covering your ass, and bringing up specifics at performance reviews or on interviews. If a job asks you to turn in your notes upon quitting, keep a personal copy. (Redact sensitive / protected info if necessary for legal compliance reasons)
	•	Go to work happy hours but don’t get schwastey when management is around. Social impressions make as much of an impact as workplace impressions on management. And it’s a great way to build solidarity with your coworkers if you’re out without the bosses around. (You can drink a lil more then too)
	•	Engage in collective organizing with your peers whenever possible. Unions are great but rare in tech. But even without unions, always share salary info and make it a point to advocate not just for yourself but for your peers. It not just feels good to stand up for whats right, but your peers will often return that energy, and everyone benefits from that solidarity

BOUNDARIES

	•	Get a second cell phone to be your business line / phone for work related apps. This is better than a personal phone because you can turn it off at 5, and better than a company-provided phone because you will keep the number and the connections when you quit, not your employer. Turn it off outside of working hours. If a potential job or current job asks for a phone number, this is the ONLY one they get.
	•	Don’t shit where you eat. Absolutely no flirting or sex with coworkers, and I even try to avoid it within my industry (oops) You never know who you’ll run into, and you want to be known as a professional. Unfortunate as it is, slut shaming is still widespread.
	•	If you get harassed at work, or by colleagues outside of the office, document it as thoroughly as possible! Start recording on your phone, or write up a thorough account with a timestamp afterwards. Gather witness statements if possible. Then read up on your rights and file a report with HR using the correct legal terms. HR is not your friend, but they will work for you if they know you know your rights. The EEOC is a great resource here if you’re not familiar with your labor rights.
	•	Don’t stay at a company that expects you to put yourself or others in danger. People shit on OSHA a lot but it’s a great resource if you’ve got a boss who doesn’t value your safety.
	•	If your boss asks you to commit fraud, like falsifying timesheets, financial paperwork, or signing off on shit you don’t have the authority to, don’t. You will be held legally liable. If your employer’s fraud is discovered, you will be scapegoated. They have low-level employees do this stuff deliberately, to direct liability away from the corporation as a whole.
	•	Be outgoing and friendly at work and in your field, but do not talk about stuff like… Recreational drug use, excessive drinking, sex or dating, illegal shit, gaming the system, or shit-talking peers.
	•	If you’re going to gossip, make it positive! Talk up people’s good qualities and achievements, and speak kindly even behind people’s backs. (Big exception is warning other women or people in marginalized groups in the workplace about people who act predatory, whisper networks have saved my ass more times than I can count and I always return the favor)
	•	Remember a job is just a job. Don’t tie your own self worth into the success or failure of corporate interests. There’s so much more in life than the place that pays you :)
