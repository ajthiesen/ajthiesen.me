> It's just a mindset.

People complain about things all the time. As you listen/watch/read/etc, listen to their complaints, and think about how you might improve that situation with technology you're familiar with. I find that I think of several ideas a week with this approach.

The next step is to think about the #product definition. What _exactly_ does it do? How does it work? How much will that cost to operate? How much is it worth to the potential customer? Given those two figures, is this an opportunity you want to investigate further?

If it passes the first simple tests, then you need to expand a bit: 
- How many possible customers are there? 
- Is it tied to geography or language, or culture? 
- How will you market the product, and what will acquire a customer cost you? 
- Do you have a free tier? A trial period? 
- Can there be a premium tier?

If you can get past this fundamental #analysis, then you need to put some more time into it. Most ideas won't get this far. You should now try to talk to some potential customers, see if your idea will work for them, and refine the product, its business model, and the implementation costs.

Many, many websites describe how to do this. If you're not already a reader, maybe try indiehackers.com as a starting point.
