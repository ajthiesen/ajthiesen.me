[Ask Siri, Dictation & Privacy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/ask-siri-dictation/) outlines the default behavior for Siri and Dictation. If you opt in to Improve Siri and Dictation, additional data is collected, stored, and reviewed. For more information, visit www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/improve-siri-dictation.

When You Make Requests, Siri Sends Certain Data About You to Apple to Process and Help Respond to Your Requests

When you use Siri on this device, the things you say are sent to and processed on Siri servers.

When you use Dictation, your device will indicate in Keyboard System Preferences if your voice inputs and transcripts for general text Dictation (for example, composing messages and notes, but not dictating in a search box) are processed on your device and not sent to Siri servers. Otherwise, the things you dictate are sent to and processed on the server.

When you use Siri and Dictation, your device will send other Siri Data, such as:

  

• Contact names, nicknames, and relationships (for example, “my dad”), if you set them up in your contacts

• Music and podcasts you enjoy

• Names of your and your Family Sharing members’ devices

• Names of accessories, homes, scenes, and members of a shared home in the Home app

• Labels for items, such as people names in Photos, Alarm names, and names of Reminders lists

• Names of apps installed on your device and shortcuts you added through Siri

  

Your requests are associated with a random identifier, not your Apple ID.

  

Siri Data, which also includes computer-generated transcripts of your Siri requests, is used to help Siri and Dictation on your Mac, understand you better and recognize what you say.

  

Siri Data is associated with a random, device-generated identifier. This random identifier is not linked to your Apple ID, [[Email]] address, or other data Apple may have from your use of other Apple services.

  

Siri Data and your requests are not used to build a marketing profile, and are never sold to anyone.

  

If you have Location Services turned on, the location of your device at the time you make a request will also be sent to Apple to help Siri and Dictation improve the accuracy of its response to your requests. To deliver relevant responses, Apple may use the IP address of your internet connection to approximate your location by matching it to a geographic region.

  

Only the Minimum Data Is Stored on Siri Servers

  

When you use Siri, Apple stores transcripts of your interactions with Siri and may review a subset of these transcripts to develop and improve Siri, Dictation, and other language processing features like Voice Control.

  

When you use Dictation, your device will indicate in Keyboard System Preferences if your voice inputs and transcripts for general text Dictation (for example, composing messages and notes, but not dictating in a search box) are processed on your device and not sent to or stored on Siri servers by default. Otherwise, Apple stores transcripts of the things you dictate and may review a subset of these transcripts to develop and improve Siri, Dictation, and other language processing features like Voice Control.

  

Your request history is associated with the random identifier for up to six months. Your request history may include transcripts, audio for users who have opted in to Improve Siri and Dictation, Siri Data and related data such as device specifications, device configuration, performance statistics, and the approximate location of your device at the time the request was made. After six months, your request history is dissociated from the random identifier and may be retained for up to two years to help Apple develop and improve Siri, Dictation, and other language processing features like Voice Control. The small subset of requests that have been reviewed may be kept beyond two years, without the random identifier, for ongoing improvement of Siri.

  

If you choose to allow third-party apps to integrate with Use with Siri, some data from these apps may be sent to Apple to help Siri understand your request, and portions of your request will be shared with the app to help provide a response or take an action (for example, send a message or book a ride). When Siri interacts with a third-party app on your behalf, you are subject to that app’s terms and conditions and privacy policy. If you choose to allow apps to use Siri for transcription, the voice data to be transcribed may be sent to Apple.

  

Your Siri settings will sync across your Apple devices using end-to-end encryption if you use iCloud. If you have set up Hey Siri, a small sample of your requests will also sync using end-to-end encryption to improve personalized Hey Siri recognition on each device. The personalized speech recognition models and your interactions with Dictation that are performed on device may leverage your on-device information to improve accuracy and model performance.
