I usually love Fridays. Love them. Your at the start of the weekend, you have a couple of glorious days of freedom from *the grind*. You get to unwind, maybe go to dinner. Have some drinks. BBQ. Whatever you do to unwind. 

Except this Friday. 

This morning I was “laid off” from #Sensory. I don’t mind the being “laid off” part. I get that. Business is business. The part the frustrates me the most is that in my probably five different interviews I said repeatedly that all I want is longevity and stability. 

Eleven months to the day, later I am laid off.

I got the feeling things were going to go sideways a few weeks back. So I started looking. Things really sealed the deal for me in our last All Hands/Town Hall when the CRO announced that “Working from home didn’t work…” and that “The company was going in a new market direction…” Andy Jassey this CEO is not. He thinks he’s the next Elon or Cook. The reality couldn’t be further from the truth. 

When you look at the numbers, #WFH and #WFX work. 

- Performance can increase up to 13 percent by working from home. 
- Working Remotely Can Increase Productivity up to 77%. 
- A [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167268112000893) conducted in 2012 shows those office workers who were assigned boring tasks performed better and faster in the regular office setting.
- Prodoscore [reports](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200519005295/en/) an increase in productivity by **47%** since March of 2020 (compared to March and April 2019)  
- Workers in a home environment report they are less distracted by co-workers, spending 30 minutes less talking about non-work topics, and spend **7%** less time talking to management.
- Airtasker reports **70%** of people rank work social relationships as important as getting the work done. Working from home minimizes the amount of social interaction.
- A study conducted by Ask.com found that **86%** of employees prefer to work by themselves when they are trying to be as productive as possible.

The above numbers are drawn from [this](https://www.apollotechnical.com/working-from-home-productivity-statistics/) article. 

Andy Jassey at #Amazon sees that everyone works differently and has given his employees the option of [where](https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22721096/amazon-work-from-home-policy-teams-decide-covid-19-pandemic) they want to work. 

I guess what I’m getting saying is the grass isn’t always greener on the other side. I don’t know. I’m kind of rambling and I’m tired. A long day with a lot of emotions. I’ll probably update this later.
