This was a 'blog' post for a website called Code Taco that I briefly ran. And then gave up.

Welcome to <Code ðŸŒ®/> aka Code Taco aka Grumpy Millenial. This is an old school formatted blog built on new school technology.

I got tired of looking at blogs about tech, and life, the universe, and everything that fucking spam you with a million ads just to figure out how to exit vim, with pop-ups, overs, unders, and every other damn form of advertising and tracking under the sun that every site you visit damn near unreadable or unuseable.

THIS SITE HAS NONE OF THAT BULLSHIT!

There are no cookies, or cookie-consents because I am not tracking you. I dont give a shit where you are reading this from, or what you are doing. I dont care what browser you are using, what OS you are using, or how long you are staying on this website. I dont give a damn about fingerprints or any of that other ridiculous invasive shit.

ðŸš¨ This is your first and only warning. ðŸš¨

This blog and its subsequent posts may not contain language suitable for all readers. If you can't handle the occasional four letter word, you should probably fuck right off.
