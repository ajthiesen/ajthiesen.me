The article discusses the possibility of a systemic naval cyber compromise, in which an adversary gains access to a country's naval network and is able to manipulate or disable critical systems. The article presents a hypothetical scenario in which a country's naval fleet is paralyzed at the pier, and argues that the consequences of such an event could be catastrophic.

The article relates to cybersecurity at a national level because it highlights the importance of protecting critical infrastructure and networks, particularly in the context of national security. The naval network is just one example of a critical infrastructure that could be targeted by cyber adversaries, and the consequences of a successful attack could be severe. The article emphasizes the need for robust cybersecurity measures to be in place to prevent such attacks and to mitigate the damage if they do occur.
