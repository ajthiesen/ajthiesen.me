**Thought:**
How can I make my Zettel tags personal to me, my writing, and my knowledge creation and curation?

**Reflection(s):**
As I have been thinking about how to create my approach to [[My Zettelkasten Algorithm]], I have been thinking about how to best add 'tags' to my writing. 

One of my favorite trees is the [[Giant Sequoia]] (Sequoiadendron giganteum).  

The lifecycle of the [[Giant Sequoia]] is broken down into three stages. Those stages are:
- cone
- seedling
- tree

As I create a new Zettel, they will *usually* (but not always) have one of these three tags associated with the Zettel. 

A Zettel with a #cone tag is an idea, a passing thought, a snippet, or some other piece of information. 

A Zettel with a #seedling tag, is the evolution of a #cone tag.  It is the expansion of an idea or thought that is more fully developed and may be in the process of becoming a #tree tag. 

A Zettel with a #tree tag is the final evolution of a #cone  tag. A #tree  tag is a final thought that has been fully fleshed out or created.
