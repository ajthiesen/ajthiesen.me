**Thought:**
*My* algorithmic approach to Zettelkasten.

**Reflection(s):**
Reading, absorbing, and reflecting on the Introduction to the Zettelkasten Method from (here)[https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/] has forced me to reflect more on how I not only collect data, but also internalize and reflect on this data in the course of my personal and professional life. 

Just writing this paragraph, I feel more calm and confident about what I am doing, then I have been in previous attempts to create meaning and relationships in my knowledge.

I feel like there is a very close synergy to an independent Zettel with the [[GTD]] methodology.
