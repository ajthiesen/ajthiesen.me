**Thought:**
Reading and reflecting on API best practices from a Hacker News post. This was a good exercise in reflection and reading on best practices when developing an API. 

**Reflection(s):**
The author discusses challenges with API usability. They highlight several points that contribute to a negative developer experience:
1. Poor documentation: Clear and descriptive documentation is crucial.
2. Lack of examples: Clear examples of API functions, return values, errors, and API calls are essential.
3. Obscure language examples: Use common languages for examples, especially for web APIs.
4. Unclear authentication: Provide clear explanations and examples of authentication processes.
5. Testing difficulties: Offer a free sandboxed environment for developers to test integrations.
6. Over-engineering: Avoid overly complex options and responses.
7. Excessive API calls: Minimize high-latency operations and unnecessary calls.
8. High friction to start: Avoid unnecessary sign-ups or sales calls to access documentation and sandbox.
9. Response format: Prefer JSON over XML for simplicity.
10. Breaking changes: Version the API to support existing applications while making improvements.

In the future, API developers are likely to place an even greater emphasis on clear documentation, standardized examples, and streamlined testing environments. Improved authentication methods and reduced friction to access documentation and sandboxes are expected. As technology advances, developers might adopt more efficient response formats while maintaining backward compatibility to avoid disrupting existing applications.
