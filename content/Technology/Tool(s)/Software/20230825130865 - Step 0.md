# Start Here
Depending on what the goal of your project is, this probably is a good place to start. 

## Domain
Buy your **own** [[Domain Name]]. It should be memorable but also reflective of you. For example `ajthiesen.com` Is a **great** domain for ==me==. Itâ€™s literally my name. Since I leverage both public and private *subdomains* I can use `mail.andrewthiesen.co` or any other subdomain I want/need. 

## Backups
#Backup. Backup. Backup. Then backup again for good measure. In fact, stop reading and run a back up now. If you can't say **immediately** when your last backup was, it has been too long. 

In fact, I'm going to run a backup now, before I do anything else.

I leverage a [[3-2-1 backup method]], that m ensures I have at **the very least** everything backed up in at minimum two places. 

1. TimeMachine: TimeMachine is my _local_ backup method. A spare 2 TB external hard drive has been repurposed to sit on my desk. I plug it in once a week, *usually* on Fridays, and force a backup every "week", or when I remember to do it.
2. [Backblaze](https://secure.backblaze.com/r/02w46x) is my #offsite/cloud backup solution. Get a free month of Backblaze backups on me to try it out.
