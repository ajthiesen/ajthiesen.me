Unix time is a date and time representation widely used in computing. It measures time by the number of seconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970, the Unix epoch, without adjustments made due to leap seconds. In modern computing, values are sometimes stored with higher granularity, such as microseconds or nanoseconds.
