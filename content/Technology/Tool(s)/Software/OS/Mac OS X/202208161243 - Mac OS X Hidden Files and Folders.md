By default, the `~/Library/` folder is hidden from users as it contains sensitive files that are critical for the operating system to work properly.

To permanently *enable* the `~/Library/` folder and show hidden directories found there, you can use a Terminal command to apply this setting.

 1.Open the Terminal app by openingÂ Finder > Applications > Utilities > Terminal app.

 2.Type the following command and press enter:
 `chflags nohidden ~/Library/`

 3.To reverse this setting, type the following command into Terminal and press enter:
 `chflags hidden ~/Library/'
