**Thought:**
Through my journey of [[Day 7 - Reflections on PKM | PKM]], I initially used #EagleFiler, but I ended up replacing It, with #Obsidian.

**Reflection(s):**
EagleFiler by [C-Command Software](https://c-command.com/) is a digital filing cabinet, a research assistant, snippet collector, and document #organizer. You can use it to write a #journal, track all the files for a #project or job, manage your bookmarks, save your favorite Web articles, store financial statements and receipts, run a paperless office, plan a trip, collect your course notes, archive your e-mail #correspondence, search mailing list archives, research a purchase, remember recipes to cook or books to read, store scientific papers, sort photos, gather legal case notes, or assemble a #scrapbook. Itâ€™s the most flexible tool on your Mac.
