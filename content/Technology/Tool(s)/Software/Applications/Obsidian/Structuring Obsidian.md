# Intro.
We as humans don’t have just *one* thought. Consciously and unconsciously our brains are always working. Receiving data from our eyes, passing that data in **millionths** of a second into to brain, and in turn activating hundreds or  thousands of neurons to interact with our Central Nervous System to perform an action.

I’m sure that I am missing a lot of steps involved, and no one should listen to me when it comes to neurology. For a deeper dive on how the mind works, the effects of light and sunshine and mood; you should check out Andrew Huberman at [HubermanLabs](https://hubermanlab.com/) or listen to [[Jocko Podcast - 332]].
## Methodology
Since #Obsidian leverages a #wiki linking strategy the way I want to organize my thoughts and ideas makes sense.  Finally! With the addition that for a couple of extras dollars I get the feature AND support the development of a product that is quickly becoming.

My writing *usually* fall into various classifications ie #technology, #travel, or #fishing, etc. *However* that’s more the exception rather then the rule. 

### Core Plugins:
[[Unique Note Creator Configuration and Template]] : Creates a UUID for my #Zettels.

### Community Plugins:
[[obsidian-emoji-toolbar]] : To insert emojis into notes from #Obsidian.

### Tags:
A #cone is the smallest form of a [[Giant Sequoia]].  It is the the *seed* that all [[Giant Sequoia]]’s are born from. This type of Zettel  is a passing thought for public consumption, or an **idea** that I am working on developing into a #sapling. 

> A seed is a small packet of genetic information. This tough, protective capsule contains all the biological instructions needed to grow a new plant…

A #sapling is a small tree that has taken root from a #cone and is growing into a tree. In my case, I am nurturing a #cone of an #idea, #thought, whatever and am working on developing it into something...I guess, *real* is the best word?

A #sequoia is the final culmination of a #cone to a #sapling and finally to a complete organic piece of work. A #sequoia thought is a rare piece of work in these notes. #sequoia notes are fully completed thoughts with a beginning, middle, and end; that are notpurely informatrional pieces of errata that exist within these pages. Rather, they are completed projects, which I have put significant time and energy into developing.
