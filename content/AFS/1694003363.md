**Thought, Comment, Idea:**

[[Time]] is a lie. People say that everyone has the same [[24h]] in a day. That's not true. Ok. It's true in the sense that [[Time]] continues to move forward for everyone at the same pace. However, it's how an individuals [[Time]] is used and spent that is variable or correlative to their socioeconomic position, relative to a [[peer]] group.
