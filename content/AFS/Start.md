# Start

I am a Father to wonderful children. A lifelong Student, a craft beer guy (specifically **any** great [[IPA]]'s, and a taco connoisseur. 

I build things with technology, tools, and applications personally and professionally. 

These are my public [[Zettelkasten]] notebooks built withÂ [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), [Omnivore](https://omnivore.app), [DEVONThink](https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink) and more. 

These [[note(s)/Zettel(s)]] are a work in progress. Anticipate changes often.

To get an understanding of how I am organizing it, can read my section on [[Technology/Tool(s)/Software/Applications/Obsidian/Structuring Obsidian]] for a more thorough reasoning and breakdown.
