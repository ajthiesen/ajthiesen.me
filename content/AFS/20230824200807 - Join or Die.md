_Join, or Die._ a 1754 political cartoon by [Benjamin Franklin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin "Benjamin Franklin")published in _[The Pennsylvania Gazette](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pennsylvania_Gazette "The Pennsylvania Gazette")_ in [Philadelphia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia "Philadelphia"), addresses the disunity of the [Thirteen Colonies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteen_Colonies "Thirteen Colonies") during the [French and Indian War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_and_Indian_War "French and Indian War"); several decades later, the cartoon resurfaced as one of the most iconic symbols in support of the [American Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution "American Revolution").

The cartoon is a [woodcut](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodcut "Woodcut") showing a [snake](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake "Snake") cut into eighths, with each segment labeled with the initials of one of the [American colonies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteen_Colonies "Thirteen Colonies") or regions. [New England](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England "New England")was represented as one segment, rather than the four colonies it was at that time. [Delaware](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware_Colony "Delaware Colony") was not listed separately as it was part of [Pennsylvania](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Pennsylvania "Province of Pennsylvania"). [Georgia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony_of_Georgia "Colony of Georgia"), however, was omitted completely. As a result, it has eight segments of a snake rather than the traditional 13 colonies.[[3]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join,_or_Die#cite_note-3) The poster focused solely on the colonies that claimed shared identities as [Americans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans "Americans"). The cartoon appeared along with Franklin's editorial about the "disunited state" of the colonies and helped make his point about the importance of colonial unity. It later became a symbol of colonial freedom during the [American Revolutionary War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War "American Revolutionary War").
