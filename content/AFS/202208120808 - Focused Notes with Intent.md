I have a problem with focus due to [[Adult ADHD]]. 

One of my primary symptoms is knowledge retention and recall. When I find, or search something that I need like a(n):

- article
- link
- tutorial 
- book

I make a note of it, and then promptly forget all about it until a few months later when I find it searching for something else and get distracted again. 

**These** thoughts/notes/ideas in #Obsidian are #focused and have #intent. As I read something or have a thought they go into #Obsidian. 

What does that mean? It means that as I consume something. I make notes about it and then reflect on it to attempt to #retain more of the content.
