# 202208101847 - From Hobbyist to Hero - Building an ISP in Rural Michigan

**Thought:**

This guy is either brilliant or insane. I'm torn on which it is. ðŸ˜‚

**Reflection(s):**

In a remarkable turn of events, [[Jared Mauch]], a resident of rural Michigan, has evolved from a frustrated Internet user to a local hero. In January 2021, Mauch decided to take matters into his own hands when he couldn't get reliable broadband service from major providers like AT&T and Comcast. Fast forward to today, and he's expanding his fiber-to-the-home Internet service with the help of $2.6 million in government funding from the American Rescue Plan's Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds.

## Bridging the Broadband Gap

Initially serving approximately 30 rural homes, including his own, through his ISP, Washtenaw Fiber Properties LLC, Mauch now boasts about 70 customers and plans to extend his network to nearly 600 more properties. Washtenaw County, where Mauch resides, received $71 million for infrastructure projects, some of which was allocated to broadband initiatives. The county had already identified underserved locations through a pre-pandemic broadband study. When federal funds became available, they issued a request for proposals (RFP) to wire up these underserved areas.

In a bold move, Mauch bid on and won the entire project for his area through a competitive bidding process, making his ISP one of four selected by the county for various regions. Currently, his network spans around 14 miles of fiber, and he plans to add an additional 38 miles to complete the government-funded expansion. In this sparsely populated rural region, some homes are located quite a distance apart, with costs exceeding $30,000 per home to provide service.

## Affordable and Reliable Internet

Under the terms of the contract signed in May 2022, Mauch is obligated to provide 100Mbps symmetrical Internet with unlimited data for just $55 per month and 1Gbps with unlimited data for $79 per month. Unlike larger ISPs, Mauch offers simple billing with no hidden fees. He's also committed to participating in the Federal Communications Commission's Affordable Connectivity Program, which provides $30 per month subsidies for eligible households.

While the contract specifies completion by the end of 2026, Mauch has set more ambitious goals, aiming to complete half of the project by the end of this year and the remainder by the end of 2023, with a total funding amount of $2,618,958.03.

## Taking on the Big Players

Operating an ISP isn't Mauch's primary job; he still works as a network architect at Akamai. However, his journey began about five years ago when major ISPs failed to offer him adequate service. AT&T provided only 1.5Mbps DSL at his home, and Comcast demanded a whopping $50,000 to extend its cable network to his house.

Before launching his ISP, Mauch used a 50Mbps fixed wireless service. Besides serving home Internet customers, he provides free 250Mbps service to a local church and fiber backhaul to several cell towers for a major mobile carrier.

## A Historic Broadband Investment

Washtenaw County heralds Mauch's initiative as a "historic broadband infrastructure investment," allocating $15 million to broadband projects by combining federal funds with the county's general budget. Collectively, Washtenaw Fiber Properties and three other ISPs selected by local authorities aim to connect over 3,000 households in the coming years.

## Challenges and Triumphs

Mauch's journey hasn't been without challenges. Increasing equipment costs have posed a hurdle, with fiber conduit and equipment prices more than doubling in some cases. Despite this, he remains committed to his mission. Last year, a generous local family contributed nearly six figures to fund an expansion that brought Internet access to their neighbors.

As for network management, Mauch reports smooth operations with generally 500Mbps of traffic and the capacity to ramp up to 4Gbps when needed. He has a team in place to handle emergencies, allowing him to take vacations. During a recent trip to Europe, a power outage occurred in his area, affecting some customers, but thanks to a generator at his house, his network stayed online.

Mauch's newfound reputation in the community is evident, with neighbors saving his number as 'fiber cable guy.' He's formed connections and made a significant impact, proving that one person's determination can bridge the digital divide in underserved regions.
