The study of cryptids is not merely an academic exercise, which should be confined to oyr sacred halls of knowledge and learning. .

tion of the field research, examination, documentation and recording should be included. 

While many students find the comfortable classroom setting an acceptable substitute for the advancement of cryptoâ€™s research, a *true* cryptozooologist will immerse themselves not only in the academic side of research but also the practical side of field research. 

This text has been designed for those students who are ready to expand their research. 

This text covers biology, ecology, practical field research planning, travel, and safety. While on the surface this may sound like a simple process each individual section entails additional information, tools, tips, and notes about ensuring that your field research proposal is approved by both educational, and in certain circumstances government agencies, entities, and other [[NHOs]]. 

This text has been developed after decades of field research in the cryptid habitats. My goal is that you, my students and colleagues will question my methodology in developing this document and continue to research, question, examine, and improve the study of cryptid research for future generations. 

the cryptid appetite is insatiable. Every year we must face the reality that their demands constantly increase, and we must do everything that we can to manage their appetite.
