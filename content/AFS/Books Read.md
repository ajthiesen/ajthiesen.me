# Books Read
1. Only books I [[Books Read| finish]] go on the [[Books Read|list]]. I don't track books I don't finish. Too much work.
2. Each finished book gets a number.
3. If I re-read a book, and finish it again, it goes on the list again with another number, but I also indicate it is a re-read with a ``^`` after the title.
4. Paper, e-books, and audiobooks all count, so long as I finish them.
5. Some of the books that dont have a `Month` entry are because I forgot *exactly* what month I read them, but I did read them.
