# 202208221159 - Train Tours

_Chicago, Illinois to Emeryville, California_  
**Distance:** 2,438 miles  
If you want to do the entire route and retrace the trail pioneers took when settling the American West, the 50-plus-hour ride is a great way to appreciate _not_ doing this in a covered wagon. The main event starts in Denver, where the train journeys through the towering Rocky Mountains, into the red rocks of Utah, through Ruby Canyon, the Sierras, Donner Pass, and, finally, San Francisco Bay. It's the best way to take in the grandeur of the West short of renting an RV.
