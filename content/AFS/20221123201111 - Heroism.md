> Heroism cannot conquer all. You'll run into someone better someday.
Better to be truly dangerous and let them come like sheep to the slaughter. Let
the other fool die for his honor. Your job is to kill him, not with grace and
style, but with anything that comes to hand."

Heroism can involve many different qualities, including courage, compassion, and selflessness, and it is not simply about defeating others in battle. Instead, heroism can involve standing up for what is right, helping those in need, and striving to make the world a better place. It is important to remember that true strength comes from using our abilities and resources for good, rather than seeking to harm others.
