## Plot

The Interdependency is a thousand-year-old human empire of 48 star systems connected by the Flow, a network of "streams" allowing [faster-than-light travel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faster-than-light_travel "Faster-than-light travel"). Each stream is one way and has an entry point and an exit point. There is no [faster-than-light communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faster-than-light_communication "Faster-than-light communication") faster than the Flow, and interstellar trips are not instantaneous—ships carrying mail or passengers from Hub, the capital of the empire and the system with the most Flow connections, arrive at End, the most distant, nine months later—but the network permits life-sustaining intersystem trade. As a natural phenomenon, the Flow is poorly understood; Earth disconnected from the network thousands of years ago, and civilization on another system collapsed more recently when its pathway suddenly closed.
