**Thought:**
> “I’m not the kind of manager who gets in his subordinates’ way when they’re busy, unless they’re doing something wrong — and yeah, they usually are — but the thing is, the management wisdom is, you have to let them make those mistakes, and then gently rub their noses in it, for them to learn. And it’s easier to delegate like that with a cold Bud in your hand.”

> “In fact the senior partners fly to Thailand together each January for three weeks, to do coke and fuck hookers, as a team, and to strategize the future of the firm.”

**Reflection(s):**
I think this book was on sale in Apple Books and the title and cover looked funny and caught my eye. I’m not one to ruin a story with #spoilers, so read this one for yourself. However, this is very much an adult book. It has rough language, and *dark* humor. I mean, just look at the couple of lines that I ripped out from it that made me chuckle.
