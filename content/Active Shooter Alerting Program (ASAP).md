Active Shooter Alerting Program (ASAP)

By: AJ thiesen

Etc etc etc

Summary:

Columbine. Sandy Hook. Parkland. Uvalde. These are horrific crimes, perpetrated by disturbed individuals, that by accounts had made repeated, overt, signals in social media (SM) posts about their intentions to become “actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a populated area.”

When the perpetrators acted, their actions occurred on or near (Astudillo) school grounds, where students should be safe. 

Research published by the FBI indicates a disturbing increase in Active Shooter (AS) events. From the period 2019 through March 25, 2022, there has been an increase of 85% of AS events. This statistic is not inclusive of the remainder of calendar year, 2022, as that number will increase.

The highest concentration(s) of AS events occurred in commercial and educational areas. Specifically, Businesses Open to Pedestrian

Traffic 44 events (27.5%) and Schools (Pre-K to 12) 27 events (16.9%) had the greatest incidents of AS events from the period 2019 through March 25, 2022. Again, this statistic is not inclusive of the remainder of calendar year, 2022, as that number will increase.

While commercial and educational locales have the perception of higher incidents of AS events, there is no single location where an AS event may occur.AS events have occurred in hookah bars, night clubs, grocery stores, shipping warehouses rail yards, and military installations.

Given these disturbing numbers, the reality is that AS events will continue, with a steady, if not increased velocity over the next six months for the remainder of calendar year 2022 and beyond.

Problem(s):

1. AS events unfold rapidly. The length of an AS event is measured in minutes. “In 63 incidents where the duration of the incident could be ascertained, 44 (70%) of 63 incidents ended in 5 minutes or less, with 23 ending in 2 minutes or less.”  

2. AS events are chaotic and kinetic by nature. The incoming information to an ECC is inherently unclear due to ‘fog of war’ by unprepared, untrained: staffers, educators, and students.   

• How many AS are there?

• What are they wearing?

• How many weapons do they have?

• What kind of weapons are there?

• How many shots have been fired?

• Are there IEDs, SVs, and/or VB-IEDs present and/or visible?

Critical response times are inhibited by the volume of calls to an ECC during an AS event resulting in confusion, communication failures, and potential blue on blue. ECC staffers must control the flow of accurate information to First Responders, even as an AS event is occurring where a friend, family member, or loved one may be present or, involved. 

The ability for successful Command and Control (C2) of information and personnel during an AS event decreases as the combined use of SM channels (Text/SMS messaging, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, etc.) are flooded by victimsand families seeking information on whereabouts and status of victims, and possible victims of an AS event.

3. As C2 decreases, the number of personnel on-site at the location of the AS event increases. Bystanders, loved ones, ancillary emergency personnel (Red Cross, EOD/SWAT, Mutual Aid LEO), and particularly the media inhibit the operational tempo required by First Responders to:  

1. Execute tactical CQB and room clearing operations to identify victims and survivors.

2. Execute tactical CQB and room clearing operations to identify and persecute AS elements.

3. Execute operationally accurate and legally correct detainments and arrests.

4. Render First Aid, perform Emergency Triage, evacuate ambulatory and non-ambulatory victims.

5. Identify and Secure evidence for criminal investigations.

6.  

Solution(s):

SensoryCloud can detect:

• gunshots 

• Fire alarms 

SensoryCloud should develop an application I have tentatively called Active Shooter Alerting Program (ASAP) to leverage the SensoryCloud SoundID models into a tool to alert Emergency Communications Centers (ECC) when these sounds are detected, initiating emergency response(s) by First Responder units to a Mass Casualty (Mass Cas) event prioritized at reducing the time between initial 911 (ECC) contact to a Code 4 resolution.
