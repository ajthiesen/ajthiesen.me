What makes a business or an idea a success?  Depending on who you are, success might be defined as:

  

How much money a business or idea makes

Total subscribers 

Or 

Making the Forbes richest list

  

For others, it might be defined as a passive income, or the ability to take a vacation. 

  

This podcast doesn’t look at any of those.

  

Flopped examines the biggest failures throughout history. How they started, how they fared, why they failed, and where they are now.
