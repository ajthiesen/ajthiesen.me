**Thought:**
Through the course of my job-search(s), I have been tasked with completing various [[personality assessment]] and inventories.

**Reflection(s):**
I have *always* believed that the majority of personality assessments are *flawed*. General assessments like [Myers–Briggs Type Indicator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers–Briggs_Type_Indicator) are useful for the general evaluation of an individual, however they do not capture *all* of the individual aspects that comprise a person. 

I'm not the only person who has this belief. 

A number of scientific journals, and legitimate media outlets have reported the bias of these tests. You can read those articles in detail [here](https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-echochambers-28315137), [here](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/05/06/myers-briggs-type-indicator-does-not-matter/3635592002/), [here](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-accurate-are-personality-tests/), and [here](https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/the-problem-with-the-myers-briggs-personality-test).

Traits such as:
- humility
- communication
- soft-skills
- determination/grit
- resilience 

I would suggest that all of these soft skills represent a person as a **whole**, not as a number on a scale, or as a series of letters. While I do not take complete stock in these assessment completely, I do believe certain ones, have some value.
