By the age of 30, every man should be able to fly.

Setting the bar too high? Ok, ok. We should at least be able to tie our own shoelaces. Still too high? 

I can’t help you, buddy.

What I’m getting at is for certain things in life, there is an expectation that a man knows how to _get it done_.

Now you know what “that look” meant when you were at a complete loss as to how to fix the leaky faucet that time.

In short, this post is all about elevating your overall attractiveness. It’s a list of life skills every guy should have.

## 30 Life Skills That Will Make You a Better Man

### Reading Discipline

> _Think before you speak. Read before you think._ – Fran Lebowitz

If I told you there was one thing you can do that:

-   relieves stress
-   improves your memory
-   allows you to get better sleep
-   increases your empathy
-   educates you
-   expands your vocabulary, and
-   [entertains](https://theadultman.com/live-and-learn/big-boys-toys/) you

You’d probably be interested in hearing about it, right?

Well, you already know all about it—that thing is reading.

And you should develop the discipline to do more of it, for all of the above reasons and more.

But, don’t get me wrong. I know it can be hard to find the time.

I’ve adopted my own little hack for this. I listen to audiobooks. It’s not original, but it works.


### Invest in Your Financial Future

Speaking of reading, one of the best books I’ve read in the last year is Dave Ramsey’s bestseller, _The Total Money Makeover._

If you’re in any kind of debt, I strongly suggest you pick it up. It’ll be the best $20 or so that you spend this year. I don’t say this lightly—it totally transformed [my approach to money][11]. 

The first few chapters are all about strategies to rid yourself of debt (including the snowball method of paying off your debts from highest interest rate to lowest, which is the one that worked for me). The remainder delves into strategies for investing your money (once debt free) to secure your financial future, [including][15]:

-   Invest a sizeable portion of your income in retirement accounts with tax benefits
-   Invest in stock mutual funds with good growth
-   Think long term and keep an eye on fees
-   Seek advice from a financial advisor

And while I think they’re all sound passive investment strategies (my favorite kind for many reasons), I’m also a big believer in diversification. And one of the best ways to diversify outside of stocks and bonds is, you guessed it—real estate.

I rarely give these kind of recommendations because I’m not a financial expert by any means, but for passive real estate, my most recent investment was with [DiversyFund’s][16] “Growth Real Estate Investment Trust”. I’m happy to give my recommendation based only on the positive experience I’ve had so far. The platform is easy to use, it has $0 management fees and I like that they only require a $500 minimum investment. The is also SEC approved and has stacked up [a lot of favorable reviews][17] online. 

[DiversyFund][16]

DiversyFund’s mission is to allow Americans outside of the 1% to invest in real estate and diversify how they build wealth._ _With a minimum investment of only $500, own a piece of a multifamily real estate portfolio that’s fully vetted and SEC approved.

### Cook Eggs Multiple Ways

Fried, scrambled, poached, or as an omelette, well prepared eggs make a tasty and quick meal. There is no better way to impress the lady in your life than with an impromptu breakfast.

You get extra manliness points if you perfect the art of cracking an egg with one hand.

While you’ll want to know how to make eggs the traditional way, an egg cooker is great to have when you’re short on time. I’ve got this one and it works a treat:

### Clean Properly

Leaving your mark on the world as a man does not imply literally leaving pizza sauce stains on your sofa.

Just as our hunter-gatherer ancestors knew the value of picking up scraps off the ground so as not to attract scavengers or other predators, so too should you be versed in the importance of cleaning properly.

Start by propelling yourself into adulthood and picking up a good quality mop. I like this bestseller by O-Cedar:

### Become Better With Women

If you master the majority of the skills described here, chances are that you will, by default, also become much better with women. It’s only natural. When that happens, the last thing you want is to be all spark and no fire.

Developing a “variety of techniques” will soon make you coveted by those with two X-chromosomes — that’s women for those of you not scientifically-inclined.

These posts will get you started:

But at the end of the day, there’s no quicker way to become better with women than by getting yourself out there and going on more dates.

Online dating is the least intimidating way of getting started. And compared to approaching women in person (which you should eventually learn to become good at as well), online dating allows you to connect with many more women in a much shorter time period.

Outside of the usual apps like Tinder and Bumble, and [eHarmony][28] are still used heavily by women all across the world. It’s worth your time signing up and making a profile.

Because the more you’re ‘out there’, the more practice you’re going to get.

### Learn to Budget

Okay, you covered your monthly internet service, Netflix subscription, and you even had some change left over for some snacks. Excellent.

But was it all set out in your monthly budget?

In order to live within your means, plan for the future, finance a major purpose (a new home, or that awesome man cave you’ve dreamed about) [good money management skills are a must][31].

And good money management involves that ‘b’ word.

Yep, you need a budget.

Thankfully, these days there are a bunch of online tools out there to help you budget and to get on top of your finances.

The one that I use is [PocketSmith][32].

It connects with all of your bank, credit, and loan accounts and displays them in all one sweet looking online dashboard.

But the real magic is that it enables you to forecast how your finances are going to be looking in the future. You can run “what-if” scenarios like “What if I take girls on coffee dates this month rather than go to expensive lounge bars?” or more likely, “What if I rented a cheaper place?” and see in a visual way how much money you’d save.

This allows you to figure out what you need to do to stay in control. I like PocketSmith over other tools because it’s completely cloud-based, has an awesome search function (no more spending hours hunting down that impulse transaction from two years ago), and if you upgrade, it’ll import your bank feeds automatically.

I also use its budget calendar all the time—it shows you when all your upcoming bills in calendar format. Way easier to read than the fridge.

The entire platform has really increased my awareness about where my money is going which then actually helps me break any [bad habits][33].

### Play An Instrument

Even if you’re not musically inclined, knowing the basics of playing at least one instrument is a handy skill to have. Knocking out some basic chords on a guitar or notes on a piano goes a long way in establishing your “man of the world” mystique.

Playing an instrument also boosts your coordination and concentration levels, among [other health benefits][37].

If you’re just starting out and guitar is your choice, this is a great little starter pack:

### The Art of Conversation

Knowing how to [hold a conversation][40] can be the difference between being remembered as ‘interesting,’ versus that ‘crazy idiot.’

Believe it or not, women prefer men that are interesting 99.9% of the time.

### Drive a Stick

One of the ultimate acts of manly multi-tasking—driving a stick requires proper coordination of your feet and hands.

It also gives you “full control” over your car’s performance and efficiency. That’s right, YOU dictate when you want power for acceleration or efficiency for speed.

It’s obviously ok to own an automatic car. But if a situation arises where you need to use a stick, you should have the skills to be able to step up to the occasion.

### Perform First Aid

Be it treating an accident victim for shock, setting a broken limb, or dealing with a rattlesnake bite, knowing how to perform first aid is a fantastic skill to have for any man.

Who knows, you might even save a life.

### Know How To Iron

No matter how manly you are, there is no room for wrinkles. When was the last time that you saw any man of distinction wearing a wrinkled shirt?

Knowing how to get that perfect crease on a pair of pants, spot press a suit or properly iron shirt cuffs is an absolute must. Besides, it can also save you a lot of money on [laundry][47] and dry cleaning bills.

If you don’t have a decent quality iron, you’re making things a lot harder for yourself than you need to.

It has titanium-infused ceramic soleplate which is on another level compared to my old stainless steel thing. It heats up fast, irons evenly and effectively, and is really easy to clean.

### Perform a Massage

There is more to manliness than just doing the rough and tough things. It is also necessary to be versed in the finer aptitudes of life, such as giving a massage.

Nothing will drive a woman wilder than knowing that the same hands that can slay a bear can also soothe and relax her [aching muscles][50] after a rough day.

### Ability to Diffuse Conflict

Regardless of how strong or masterful you may be in the art of fighting, a real man will always try diplomacy and stern persuasion to calm down an escalating situation. Knowing how to simmer tempers down or break up a fight makes you a leader.

Kind of like when all the the male gorillas stop their shenanigans when the alpha-male gorilla walks in.

### Present to a Group

Developing the ability to present well to a group demonstrates that you are confident and someone worth listening to.

Yes, it can take some time to master. But it’s a highly attractive skill to have and [it’ll serve you well in many situations][54]. Best man’s speech? No problem.

### Brew a Good Cup of Coffee

Caffeine is the fuel for our society. Knowing how to properly prepare the number one delivery vehicle for caffeine goes a long way in developing your well-rounded manliness.

Get some knowledge about different roasts, and learn how to use a grinder. Master different ways of brewing coffee.

Yes, this means going further than Nespresso, drip brewers and instant coffee.

You don’t need to spend a lot to get started. I’ve got this ELEHOT machine, and for the price, you really can make a great cup of espresso:

No products found.

It’s super easy to use and keep clean, looks great, and I love being able to make guests a [coffee shop level][57] cup of espresso when they come over.

### Interact With Children

Remember that cool uncle that always had an interesting story to tell or that taught you something that you didn’t already know? The reason you remember him so fondly is because he knew how to connect with you when you were a kid.

Now it’s your turn to be that cool uncle—whether it’s your actual nieces or nephews, or your friends’ kids.

Heck, be the cool uncle even if they’re your own kids.

### Change a Tire

Much like Bob Dylan, tires have a tendency of going flat from time to time.

Yes, a call to the automotive club might get it fixed for you, but what if you are out in the middle of nowhere?

You should also have something like this in your car:

### Keeping Fit

Being fit is a skill. And if you want to live a long and healthy life it’s a skill you need to develop.

Learn how to train different parts of your body, and develop an appreciation and understanding of nutrition. Then prepare or [adopt][64] a fitness plan and take action.

### Plan a Proper Date

Pizza and a movie do nothing for establishing your romance cred. In order to properly impress women, knowing how to plan a proper date is a must.

Ok, Ok. We know that some inspiration could help. We’ve got you covered. Check out our list of [30 unique location ideas for your next date][67].

### Build and Maintain a Relationship

Being a man does not involve sowing your wild oats into perpetuity. Eventually, you will find the right woman and you will want to settle down.

Yes, it will happen! When it does, knowing the basics of building and maintaining a relationship can make the difference between “happily ever after” and “hell on earth.”

### Know How to Sew

What? Sewing is for girls, isn’t it?

Wrong, sewing is, in fact, one of the most practical skills that a man can have. Think about it, ancient mariners, hunters, and warriors were some of the best sewers. It was an essential skill.

So, instead of being at a loss as to what to do when you lose a button, grab that needle and thread and get in tune with your ancient warrior past.

All you need is one of these:

### Basic Household Repairs

Things around the house break, it’s just a fact of life.

Knowing how to handle some basic repairs will save you time and money.

It will also spare you from the look the handyman will give you when he realizes you called him just to change a light bulb.

In order to make home repairs yourself, you’ll need to have an adequate set of tools on hand. This set from Black Decker is really well reviewed and has everything you need:

### Set Up a Campsite

The great outdoors. There is no better setting to show off your manly prowess than when camping. Knowing how to select and actually set up the site will earn you points among your peers.

It’s also a great excuse to buy a whole bunch of cool camping gear. Speaking of which, here’s our pick for a reliable and affordable tent:

### Build a Good Credit Score

The time will come when a futon and an improvised coffee table made from a piece of plywood and cinder blocks simply will not do.

While we believe you should only have a credit card if you know that you’ll use it responsibly within your limits, there are some benefits to be gained from owning a credit card and from building a good credit score.

For one thing, you can essentially ‘hack’ the credit card system and get a lot of awards points and other benefits, while paying zero interest. It’s simple—choose a credit card with rewards you like and always pay your entire balance down every month within the interest free period.

Doing this will also build an excellent credit score, which is hugely important if you want to take out loans or rentals.

If your credit score is bad, don’t stress, there are things you can do. Paying down your debt and never paying late is a start. You can also enlist the help of a credit repair specialists ([Credit Firm][78] is a reputable one we know about).

### Use a Barbecue

Barbecue grills involve fire. Out of all of the four classical elements, fire is definitely the manliest. It stands to reason then that knowing how to start and cook on a barbecue grill is essential to being manly. Be it charcoal, gas or wood, mastering the open air grill is a must.

Just remember gentlemen, never barbecue indoors.

### Travel in a Foreign Land

Manliness involves worldliness. There is no better way to lose your worldliness credibility than by getting lost during a beach break in Spain or a day trip to Tijuana.

When visiting another country take some time to study up on basic cultural differences. Learn some key navigational terms in the native language, download proper maps for the region, etc.

You know, don’t be a stereotypical tourist.

If you’re single, check out our list of the [best places to travel solo as a guy][83].

### Get Service at a Bar

Getting served at a bar when it is your turn is akin to claiming a birthright —it should not be a matter for debate.

Eye contact, presence, a strong tone of voice. [Knowing how to assert yourself at the bar][86] with proper composure and demeanor is essential for any man.

### Parallel Park

In the past bringing down your first prey in a hunt was your entry into manhood. In the modern world parallel parking has taken over that role.

This skill should be learned, practiced and perfected as soon as you learn how to drive. There’s nothing worse than having to park blocks from your destination simply because you couldn’t fit your car in between the Fiat and the Ford.

### Plant a Garden

Modern civilization has its roots, pardon the pun, in agriculture. What better way to demonstrate your manliness and your connection to the land than by knowing how to start and sustain a successful garden.

Whether it’s to grow vegetables, herbs, or, yes, even flowers; knowing how to garden shows off you earthly manly skills.

This is a great set of garden tools to get you started:

It includes everything you need and they’re nice and sturdy.

### Catch a Fish

By the time you’re 30, you should be aware that fish do not come originally from a can or the frozen food section of your supermarket. They actually have to be caught.

This skill is not only manly but is also a good fall back to have for survivalist reasons. Even if you never have to catch a fish to survive, it will at the very least give you a good reason to spend an entire day with friends drinking beer.

## Conclusion

There you have it. The skills every man should know. Master these and you’ll be well on your way to [becoming a better man][93].

And simultaneously increasing your attractiveness to the fairer gender.

Win/win?
