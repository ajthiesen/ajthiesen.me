![Y a todo esto, ¿de qué están hechas las calaveritas de azúcar?](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi1.wp.com%2Fwww.sopitas.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F11%2Fcalaveritas-dequeestanhechas.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=c564ec9287a027e932253ccd8349f71a1c044e5783527a567e65974e5375f25c&ipo=images)

Ingredients:

-   2 cups granulated sugar
-   1 tablespoon meringue powder
-   1 tablespoon water
-   Food coloring (optional)
-   Skull-shaped molds
-   Royal icing (for decorating)

Instructions:

1.  In a mixing bowl, combine the sugar and meringue powder. Mix well.
    
2.  Add the water to the mixture and stir until it resembles wet sand. If you want to add food coloring, now is the time to add a few drops.
    
3.  Pack the mixture into skull-shaped molds, pressing it down firmly with your fingers. Smooth the surface with the back of a spoon.
    
4.  Let the skulls dry overnight, or until they are completely hard.
    
5.  Once the skulls are dry, carefully remove them from the molds.
    
6.  Using the royal icing, decorate the skulls with colorful designs and patterns. You can use a small pastry bag or a zip-top bag with the corner snipped off to pipe the icing onto the skulls.
    
7.  Allow the icing to dry completely before displaying or eating the Calaveritas de Azúcar.
