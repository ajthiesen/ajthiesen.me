# Intro.
I love #wikis. I think they are possibly the best way to organize, clarify and link information, especially when it comes to #organizing many different thoughts and ideas. 

We as humans don’t have just *one* thought. Consciously and unconsciously our brains are always working. Receiving data from our eyes, passing that data in **millionths** of a second into to brain, and in turn activating hundreds or  thousands of neurons to interact with our Central Nervous System to perform an action.

I’m sure that I am missing a lot of steps involved, and no one should listen to me when it comes to #Neurology. For a deeper dive on how the mind works, the effects of light and sunshine and mood; you should check out Andrew Huberman at [HubermanLabs](https://hubermanlab.com/) or listen to [[Jocko Podcast - 332]]

# Methodology
Since #Obsidian leverages the wiki linking strategy the way I want to organize my thoughts and ideas makes sense.  Finally! With the addition that for a couple of extras dollars I get the [[Obsidian Publish Inspiration]] feature AND support the development of a product that is quickly becoming.

My writing *usually* fall into some type of #classification like #Technical or #Travel. These are my top level folders, with sub-folders, followed by content. 

# Core Plugins
[[Unique note creator]] : Creates a UUID for [[202208101406 - Zettelkasten Notes vs. Notes with a Title | Random Notes ]] 

# Community Plugins
[[obsidian-emoji-toolbar]] : To insert emojis into notes from #Obsidian on my #MacBook  Air. 

# Linking, Interoperability, and Tags 
At the moment my #Obsidian instance and my [[DevonThink Pro]] are linked together in what I would consider a very ‘basic’ manner based on [this](https://www.productived.net/2021/09/how-i-connect-devonthink-and-obsidian/) article. My #Obsidian instance has a defined #structure and at a very high level mimimcs a Unix type file structure with hierarchy. My #DevonThink instance on the other hand is essentially a catch-all for, well, **everything**.
