Another #podcast intro I wrote that never launched. ðŸ™ƒ  I drafted the first episode: [[Episode 1 The Original Florida Man?]]

---
There's more to Florida than just beaches and theme parks. There's a beautiful, crazy, scary, wild, and occasionally funny side to what makes Florida, well, Florida.Â 

My name is AJ, and I amÂ NOTÂ a Floridian. Well, not by birth anyway. Like most Floridians, I have ended up here, and decided to make it my home.Â 

The longer I live here, to more I find myself saying, What the Florida!?

Join me as I explore the stories, history, and yes, culture of Florida and the people who call it home. Topics like:

- Why is Key West called the Conk Republic?
- Whereâ€™s the best Key Lime Pie?
- Whats a Hurricane Party?

And, why is Cuban Coffee so damn good!?

You can find the What the Florida Podcast wherever you listen to your favorite podcasts!Â 

So, kick off your flip-flops, put the gator in its pen, and crack open a cold drink as we dig into the questions of What the Florida?
