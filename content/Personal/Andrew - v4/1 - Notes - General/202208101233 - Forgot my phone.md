Another blog post that I wrote about my #daughter .

---

I forgot my phone the other day. ü§Ø

Usually, when this happens I would be irritated. 

**This time, it was terrifying.**

A little bit of context is required here. I have a daughter. She was born six weeks early. We (my wife and I) spent eight days in the NICU with her. When we _finally_ were released from the NICU, were only home for 48 hours , before we were back at the Pediatric ICU. Our daughter was dehydrated, jaundiced, and lethargic. 

Come to find out, she had an underlying infection that was causing her to be dehydrated, jaundiced, miserable, and upset. We then spent **_another_** eight days in the PICU. She had a spinal tap, labs, and ended up seeing four different doctors due to her age/size and condition. 

Thankfully, it was a minor infection that was resolved with a course of antibiotics, but it required admission and monitoring. (She‚Äôs fine now. üôè)

So in the three weeks (~21 days) my daughter has been alive, we have been in the hospital for ~19 of those days.

In between hospital visits, me working, (my employer does not have an _official_ Paternity policy. My team is great and were able to manage with out me), and doctor follow-ups; I had to renew my drivers license.

Florida licenses are good for eight years. After that you actually have to go to the DMV and do the eye test, and show them you are who you say you are, and prove you actually live here. 

So, when I ran out of my house to deal with the DMV and forgot my phone I was upset. 

What if something happened to my wife?
What if something happened with my daughter?
What if something happened at the house and they needed to get ahold of me?

Variations of all the possible worse-case scenarios ran through my head head as i walked into the DMV. I got my number, and had about ten people ahead of me. 

I found a spot, six feet away from anyone, and sat down. Then something miraculous happened in my brain. 

Everything just, stopped.
