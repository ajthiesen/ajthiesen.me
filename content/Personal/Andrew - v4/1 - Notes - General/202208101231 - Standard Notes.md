This is my first â€˜officialâ€™ blog entry. I have started various blogs in the past and then fallen off the writing train after a couple of days. Partially itâ€™s a motivation issue and partially a time issue. Between working a full day, keeping up a family, a house, exercising, studying, etc., it can seem like a pretty daunting task to write something that almost no one is going to read. </p>
<p>However, this time is going through to be different. <strong>It has to be.</strong> I have a little new jellybean on the way (due in March ðŸŽ‰) and I have too much going on both personally and professionally to not make a commitment to improve myself.</p>
<p>I <strong>do</strong>&nbsp;believe that the <a href="https://standardnotes.com/?s=k9ea6a7q" target="_blank">Standard Notes</a>&nbsp;concept has some amazing potential, which is why I have decided to use this platform. Itâ€™s lightweight, easy to use, integrates to both my MacBook and my iPhone (where I have written the majority of this post) and for the most part, is pretty easy to use. More importantly, everything is encrypted and private, unless I tell it otherwise; like I did with this blog post.&nbsp;I do software installations and configurations all day long. So having the ability to just write is very helpful. </p>
<p>Ok. Enough for today. I have rambled long enough.<br></p>
