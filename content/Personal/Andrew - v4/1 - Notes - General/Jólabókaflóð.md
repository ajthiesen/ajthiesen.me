Iceland has a Christmas Eve tradition called “jolabokaflod” where friends and family exchange books and then spend the rest of the evening together reading them and eating chocolate

This isn't true. The term exists, but it's about as correct as saying "Did you know Americans have a tradition named "Black Friday" where they buy electronics and then gather together to enjoy a thanksgiving film together on their new flat screen?" 

"Jólabókaflóð" (Lit. Christmas Book Flood) is a marketing term. It describes the tendency of most major publishers to release most of their best-selling books and translations around christmas to bank on people gifting them to other people. Books are common gifts and all, but there isn't a specific tradition centered around them. Friends and family will _give_ books to each other if the recipient is known to enjoy reading, but _**all**_gifts are opened on Christmas Eve. Once the festivities of the night die down people will go about their night. A lot of people will go and enjoy their new gifts. If you got a book you may want to go read, but people who get jigsaws may go enjoy their puzzles, people who got technology may go set it up, people who got video games may go play them, people who got clothes may try them on, e.t.c e.t.c. Books aren't special in that regard. 

If you want to adopt a christmas book exchange be my guest, I think the romantic version that pops up every year is wholesome and all; but it isn't an Icelandic thing beyond "Icelanders have a high literacy rate and quite enjoy books, and so books are common and easy gifts to give, and publishers knowing this will try to market as many books as possible around Christmas".
