(makes 2-3 freezer meals)

-   2 pounds of ground beef
-   1 onion, diced
-   3 cans of chili beans
-   1 can Rotel tomatoes
-   1 can of diced tomatoes (14 oz can)
-   2 packs of chili seasoning
-   1/2 table spoon salt
-   2 cups water

Put browned ground beef into a pan with onions and cook until onions are soft. Add in all the other ingredients (including the juice of the tomatoes) and cook for 30 minutes or so until flavors have combined.

Itâ€™s hard to measure, but I used two gallon bags to put in 1/3 of the mixture into each, and then split the rest up into a couple smaller quart bags for chili dogs or chili chips and cheese (things where chili is not the main meal.)
