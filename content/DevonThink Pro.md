[DEVONthink](https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink) is an absolutely fantastic piece of #PKM software. I use it daily. I have figured out a good way to incorporate both #DEVONThink and #Obsidian  from [here](https://www.productived.net/2021/09/how-i-connect-devonthink-and-obsidian/) to create a personal #PKM solution that is:
- Viable
- Extendable
- Repeatable

**And** aligns with my [[202208120816 - The Sync Pyramid | Sync/Backup Strategy]].  #DevonThink is my, for lack of a better word, catch-all. It catches everything I throw at it; OCR’s my PDF’s, backs up critical #email’s, and serves as secondary #library. 

I don’t view or treat #DevonThink and #Obsidian as disparate pieces of software. Their role is more symbiotic?
