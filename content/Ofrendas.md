A typical _ofrenda_ is a simple concept. It consists of a set of items that will identify the person to whom it is dedicated along with staples of the celebration such a _[[Pan de Muerto]]_, a traditional sugary pastry adorned with bone and skull shapes made from the same bread, and marigold petals. The items that identify the person will include photographs, personal items that belonged to them, but can also include food other than the traditional one which the person in question particularly enjoyed. They will most commonly be built on a table which will be adorned with a tablecloth and china paper cut in patterns.

The standard altar will more or less be something like this: A table will be set up, if possible with two levels, by using a smaller flat surface on top. All of that will be covered on a bright-colored tablecloth and adorned with china paper cut in different patterns. On the higher up section photographs of the person will be placed along with their belongings, if available. Indicating that the offerings are meant for them. Personal items, will vary according to the age of the deceased. For children, it is common to place toys on the altar. In some places, they are even remembered separately as _[[angelitos]]_ (little angels) on the day before. However, the overall ritual remains unchanged. The lower portion of the altar is where the offerings are placed. The food will be placed here. Normally it will include traditional Mexican cuisine like tamales and mole, but also fruit such as oranges and sugarcane, as well as food or other items (cigarettes are a popular addition here) that represent the honored person’s particular tastes. Finally, it will also include a selection of food products particular to the date like _[[Calaveritas de Azúcar]]_ (sugar skulls) and _[[Pan de Muerto]]_.
