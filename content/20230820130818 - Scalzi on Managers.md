**Reflection(s):**
This line is possibly the single beat line of writing in this book.  I like [[John Scalzi]].  A lot. I’ve read a lot of his books and series [[Old Man’s War]], [[Fuzzy Nation]],[[The Interdependency Series]], to name a few. 

This line though.  This line is a very good [[manager]] or [[leader]] putting themself on the line and asking for nothing in return. A concept that is missing in today's society. The story was OK. For a one-off novel, I enjoyed it, but I had kind of an idea of the storyline based on the title. There are a few good twists in there. For some “classic” [[John Scalzi]] or if you haven’t read anything by him before, I highly suggest starting with the [[Old Man’s War]].
