# Intro 
I’m Andrew. I like to ~~build~~ ~~and~~ tinker.  This is my  ‘[[content/Digital Garden]]’ is a *now* unstructured collection of thoughts, ideas, notes, and notes built with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). 

I’m not sure if I would go so far as to say this thing is really **anything** more then a collection of *stuff* but, I don't know. Perhaps someone will glean something from this, and my ~~chaotic~~ writing style.

For more in depth analysis about my professional career please visit my [[Resume]]. 

I’m:
-   a #Father 👨‍👧‍👧 To ~~two~~ three wonderful children. 
-   a #Student 👨‍🎓
-   a craft #beer guy 🍺
-   🌮 connoisseur 

These #notes , like me, are a work in #progress. To get an understanding of how I am #organizing it, you should read [[Personal/Andrew - v4/Projects/Obsidian and Writing/1 - Notes/Structuring Obsidian]]. You will likely run across 'broken' links. That just means it’s either a private link (ie: it’s linked to my [[DevonThink Pro]] instance and not for public consumption) or, more likely, it references a thought/note/idea that I haven’t fully fleshed out yet and is waiting for me to expand on. 

There is no single linear path through these [[notes]].
