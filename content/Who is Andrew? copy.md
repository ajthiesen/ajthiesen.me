# Who is Andrew?
Thank you for your time and interest in learning more about me, Andrew Thiesen, Senior Network [[Systems]] Analyst, Florida Department of Health, Monroe County.

Its quite a mouthful isn't it? Yet, in all those words, there is not much *information*. 

There is the standard biographic information, 30-something, [[Pisces]], [[Father]], [[Brother]], [[Son]], [[Husband]]. 

My interests are *wide* and *varied*.
