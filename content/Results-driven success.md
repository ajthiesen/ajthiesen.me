I just resigned up for [[Grammerly]] and I am pulling in some old notes that I have discovered in my old instance. This is one of those notes.

Results-driven success to me means having documented, clear, achievable, transparent goals. I use Asana, Notion, and ToDoist, to identify the goals and outcomes I want to achieve, document my progress with them, and review them periodically. I measure success by ensuring that the plans are met in a timely, efficient manner and shared with the team.
