I had a very hard time this Labor Day Weekend, shopping at [[Kohls]] with my daughter for a couple of basic ties and shirts. 

I’m very…*selective* when it comes to the dress code in an office. I don’t really like to wear jeans, except maybe on Friday, but even that is rare. I don’t like very loud shirts. I prefer very basic standard colors. White. Black. Blue. Grey.  I like my ties to be simple as well. Black. Blue. Grey. That’s it. 

I am starting [[a new role]] that **is not** [[remote]] and want to ensure that I some updated clothes for my first day on [[08SEPT2023]].  Generally, I have an extreme dislike for clothes shopping for myself. I know that the reason I hate clothes shopping *mostly* because of my [[weight]] and that the quality of clothes (and everything else [[Why Everything we Buy is Worse Now.]]) is declining faster then previous years. .

I find a couple of l dress shirts that I like, that are basic colors, and try them on. They are too tight around my neck, the sleeves don’t seem to sit quite right, I don’t like the way I look in them. Then I think about how fat and disgusting I am, resolve to work out more, then go home and shove my face with [[gummy]] Lifesavers and a soda. Yeah. Really fucking healthy. 

[[Male body dysmorphia]] is real folks and it hurts. A lot. But I digress. In the extreme. 

I know. I sound like a grumpy old man with this pronouncement about only wanting to wear boring, normal, standard colors, and I probably am (the truth of the matter is I’m only in my late 30s.) There just *something* about todays clothing choices **that I do not understand.** 

I needed a black tie. Not silk, or black on black with a crazy design, or flowers, or fish, or any cute saying about anything. (Unless it’s a muted [[skull]] design, but that’s a whole different post.) 

To that end, when I know I am going to be pulling cable in a drop-ceiling in the middle of summer in the [[Florida Keys]], I’m wearing work pants and boots. Thankfully most of that work I am able to outsource though so I don’t have to do **much** of it anymore. 

I do like a good, *appropriate*, [[Dad-Mode]] [[Hula Shirt]].  Ok. So this page took some turns that I did not expect it to take. I need to spend some time cleaning up this post and organizing it to make it a little more coherent. Instead of just rambling from one subject to another. Or, do I? I mean, isn’t that really the point of [[linked thinking]] and [[free form writing]]? I m start with one thought and see where it takes me and write from there?  Something to look into.
