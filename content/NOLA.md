I had the chance to take my #wife on a birthday trip to #New_Orleans, (before Covid-19). The last time I had been, I was there for a #conference in my early 20's and spent most of the time #drunk. had  my friend Bree and I were talking about what to do and see. 

---
Below is a list of some of our faves.  Since you will be there a week you may want to try some of the tours (like the voodoo ghost tour or the steamboat Natchez ride).

Best PoBoy:
[http://parkwaypoorboys.com/about/](http://parkwaypoorboys.com/about/)
Parkway PoBoy (Closed Tuesdays)
538 Hagan Ave.
New Orleans, LA 70119

These po’boys are on French bread and come “dressed” (lettuce, tomato and mayo) or “undressed”. We love the fried shrimp and fried oyster.   Also have a land and sea po’boy with pot roast topped with fried oyster that is pretty good!  The fries can be served “dirty” with pot roast gravy on top and you can request melted cheese too J.  When we don’t have our son, we like to sit at the bar and try their cocktail specials.  Last time they had some sort of pepper infused tequila that was awesome.

Second Favorite PoBoy:

Verti Marte

  

1201 Royal St.,

  

New Orleans, LA 70116

  

We ordered ours on a bun, which is a muffuletta style bun.  Absolutely

delicious.  You will walk into this place, which looks like a hole in the

wall convenience store and go all the way to the back of the store to

order.  They take cash only and do not have a place to sit. We took ours

down the street to a local bar and they were happy to have us enjoy there.

  

  

  

Casual Dining:

  

Acme Oyster House is great.  There is usually a long line out the door

during peak times.  We have enjoyed the oysters and oyster Rockefeller

soup! [http://www.acmeoyster.com/french-quarter/](http://www.acmeoyster.com/french-quarter/)

  

Café Du Monde at the French Market Location is great for chicory coffee and

fresh beignets.  This location is good to go walking around the little

shops close by when you’re done:  [http://www.cafedumonde.com/locations](http://www.cafedumonde.com/locations)

  

The Ruby Slipper Cafe has a yummy breakfast:

Mother’s is old school soul food.  My mother in law loves coming to this

place for ham and bread pudding:

Finer Dining:

  

Any of Emeril’s restaurants are good.  I think I like NOLA best.

[http://www.mrbsbistro.com/](http://www.mrbsbistro.com/) - Mr. B’s Bistro - BBQ Shrimp is awesome (if you

are not afraid of shelling your own shrimp).  Food is terrific, but would

definitely at least stop in for a martini and some BBQ shrimp!

  

Commander’s Palace is a legend: [https://www.commanderspalace.com/](https://www.commanderspalace.com/)

  

I went to The Pelican Club a year or so ago and really liked it:

Brennan’s – We like it for brunch

  

  

  

Jazz:

  

We like to visit Frenchmen Street – which is more where the locals go for

music.  One of my favorite places there is Snug Harbor:

[http://www.snugjazz.com/about](http://www.snugjazz.com/about) - You can buy tickets ahead of time.  I’d

Uber there – parking is terrible.  But even if Snug Harbor is not your

thing, there are several venues very close together with live music.

  

We don’t spend a ton of time on Bourbon Street at night, but we did find

some great jazz with “craft” cocktails at the 21st Amendment:

Fritzels is a “European” jazz place on Bourbon I also like to visit.  The

jazz is more “old school”: [http://www.fritzelsjazz.net/](http://www.fritzelsjazz.net/)

  

  

  

The Hotel Monteleone has a famous carousel bar and will have live music

nightly.  We always stop in for at least a drink:

If you can catch the Rebirth Brass Band playing anywhere, you should go!  I

don’t know if they are in town when you will be there.

Garden District:

  

If you are staying near the Garden district,

[https://graciousbakery.com/](https://graciousbakery.com/) Gracious

Bakery was a yummy stop the last time we visited.

  

We also enjoyed pizza here: [http://www.ancorapizza.com/](http://www.ancorapizza.com/)

  

  

  

Other thoughts….

  

Cigar Factory of New Orleans has a couple locations and they roll cigars on

site. I always get one

[https://southerncandymakers.com/](https://southerncandymakers.com/) Southern Candy Makers is a great place to

get pralines/ chocolates.

  

Hansen’s is a famous Snow Ball place: [http://www.snobliz.com/](http://www.snobliz.com/)

  

There are several breweries in NOLA.  We visited this one b/c they were

hosting a Crawfish Boil and enjoyed it:
