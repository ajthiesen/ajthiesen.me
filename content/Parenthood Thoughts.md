[[Parenthood]] is a show that my #wife got us in to. It was on from 2010-2015. When she first turned it on, on #Hulu, it took me a little while to get into it. I do like [[Peter Krause]] in “9-1-1”, so I gave it a shot. 

It. Is. AMAZING! It ended up being one our Gm favorite shows to watch together. You get drama, deceit, #neurodivergence, motorcycles. 

There’s a character or situation that almost everyone can relate to. All that being said, not every single episode is a winner, **but the finale**. My wife and I both cried at the finale. 

We basically measure every show against [[Parenthood]] now. Give it a watch on #Hulu.
