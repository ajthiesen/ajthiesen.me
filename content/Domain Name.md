Buying and managing a  personal #domain is a *relatively* painless and in my opinion a first step in mastering not only [[9 Rules for DNS | DNS]] but also how a foundation for building a [[Well Architected Personal Network]]. 

Owning and managing your own domain, you can integrate it to any project you have in mind. My #domains are tied to [[Fastmail]], [[GitHub]], and [[Cloudron]], to name a few. 

You can buy a domain from really *any* domain provider. 

If you want a simple process with minimal technical input, and a number or [[Out-of-the-Box/Off-the-Shelf]] connections, then go with [[Domain.com]]

If you want a #domain that you can manage with [[9 Rules for DNS | DNS]] out of the box, I highly recommend [[Cloudflare]]. The prices are competitive and the DNS wizards are very helpful. 

If you desire more domains then you can think of what to do with, as well as custom Name Servers, and a whole slew of additional add-ons and services, go with [[Namecheap.com]].

A word about [[GoDaddy]]. **Don’t use them**.  I have only ever one domain with them, but worked with multiple clients that used them. They are a pain in the ass. The customer service is abysmal. It’s in my opinion, the worst domain registrar out there. I avoid them like the plague.
