As I get deeper into  #Obsidian , digital #garden , and #PKM. I am finding, collating, digging, organizing, and occasionally, *purging* old, outdated, or defunct things, I am starting to get into a rhythm about how I am [[content/Structuring Obsidian]]. 

Part of that structure is applying a Zettelkasten Type UUID to **new** notes. 

Using the [[Unique note creator]] from the Core Plugins, I have started creating new notes. Notes without that UUID, and just a title, are 'legacy' notes from #Evernote , #Drafts, Apple #Notes, and #OneNote.
