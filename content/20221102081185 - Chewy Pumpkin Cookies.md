### INSTRUCTIONS

#### For the Spiced Sugar

-   In a small bowl mix the granulated sugar and pumpkin pie spice together. Set aside.
    
    1/4 cup (50 g) granulated white sugar1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice
    

#### For the Pumpkin Cookies

-   Preheat oven to 350 degrees and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
    
-   Start by drying your pumpkin. (This step is not optional. The cookies will not bake properly if you skip this step.) 
    
    Spread the canned pumpkin on a plate and lightly press with a paper towel to absorb the excess liquid. Repeat the step at least four more times. 
    
    The pumpkin should be dry enough that it goes from being ½ cup dried down to just about a ¼ cup. Hardly any liquid should transfer onto a paper towel once it has been dried enough.
    
    (Like stated above, try to use Libby's canned pumpkin as almost all cans of it have the same consistency and are not too wet.) 
    
    Then set aside.
    
    1/2 cup (122 g) canned pumpkin puree
    
-   In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Set aside.
    
    1 3/4 cups (219 g) all purpose flour, spooned and leveled1 tbsp pumpkin pie spice1/2 tsp baking soda1/2 tsp baking powder1/2 tsp salt
    
-   In a large bowl cream the softened butter and brown sugar together with an electric mixer on high speed for 1-2 minutes until light and fluffy.
    
    3/4 cup (168 g) unsalted butter, softened1 cup (220 g) light brown sugar, packed
    
-   Add in the egg yolks and vanilla and mix on medium speed until pale and fluffy, about 1-2 minutes.
    
    2 egg yolks, at room temperature2 tsp vanilla
    
-   Add in the pumpkin and mix on medium-low speed to combine.
    
-   Add in the dry ingredients and mix on low speed just until combined.
    
-   Scoop the dough with a 2 tablespoon cookie scoop, and roll them into balls. Then roll the dough balls in the spiced sugar. 
    
    (If the dough is too "sticky" chill it in the fridge for 10 minutes, then proceed.)
    
-   Place the cookie dough balls at least 2 inches apart on the baking sheets. (I usually bake 6 at a time.) 
    
-   Bake the cookies for 12-14 minutes. (12 minutes for really chewy centers, 14 minutes for a slightly crispier cookie). When the cookies are done baking the centers will be puffy. As they cool the centers will fall and the cookie will get "wrinkly". 
    
-   Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer them to a cooling rack to finish cooling. They are best enjoyed when they have cooled for at least 15 minutes!
    

### NOTES

* Store the cookies in an airtight container for up to three days.

**Measure your flour properly.** This is always my #1 baking tip. Do not ever scoop a measuring cup into your flour. This will always lead to using too much flour. (Trust me, I've learned the hard way that I need to measure properly!) Instead, sprinkle spoonfuls of flour into your measuring cup and swipe excess flour off with the back of a knife. Or better yet, weigh your flour. 1 cup of flour equals 125 grams.
