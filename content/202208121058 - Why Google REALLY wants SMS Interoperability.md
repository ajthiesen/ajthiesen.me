So, Google has embarked on a campaign of SMS "Interoperability" called [Get the Message](https://www.android.com/get-the-message/?utm_source=hpp&utm_medium=owned&utm_campaign=getthemessage). This campaign, to me is both hilarious and disturbing. It is my sincere hope that [[Apple]] **does not** buy into this ridiculous/shameless data collection effort.

Google does not want to promote, nor encourage what they are calling 'Interoperability'. They want to collect your data. Again. A quick Google search of: `google data collection` turns up the following links: [What data is Google collecting from you and why?](https://www.allconnect.com/blog/does-google-collect-your-data) ,   
[Google's data collection is hard to escape, study claims](https://money.cnn.com/2018/08/21/technology/google-data-collection/index.html), [Google’s Data Collection Practices: The Scary Truth](https://blog.searchscene.com/google-s-data-collection-practices-the-scary-truth/), and [Google Data Collection Is More Extensive and Intrusive Than You Ever Imagined](https://www.cpomagazine.com/data-privacy/google-data-collection-is-more-extensive-and-intrusive-than-you-ever-imagined/), just to name a few. 

The reality is the Google wants to collect **your** data, to **sell** your profile to its partner sellers, advertisers, and and anyone else with pockets deep enough to #harvest your #data.  This is not about a “bad” messaging experience.
