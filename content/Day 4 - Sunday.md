For days into my [[100 Day Writing Challenge]] and I find this becoming an easier #habit to keep. As I laid in bed today with a million thoughts running through my head, I realized I hadn’t written yet. I had to. I needed to. Even uneventful days like today are full of things to do.
- Walk dogs. 
- Take baby on walk with dogs so #wife can sleep in a little. 
- Make coffee. 
- Pick up groceries. 
- Unload groceries. 
- Relax on couch with #wife and baby as the rain, lightning, and thunder make it nearly impossible to do anything else. 
- Watch Pirates of the Caribbean. 
- Make dinner.
- Bathe baby. 
- Attempt to put 5 month old baby to bed. 
- Go to bed. 
- Write my #100Days entry. 
- Sleep. 

There’s one thing that we did not do today that I want to get us to. Church. My #wife was raised #catholic and I’m #Lutheran. Neither of us have been to #church in years. With our #daughter here now we want to baptize her. It feels hypocritical to do a baptism in a church we have never been to. 

Maybe next weekend. Maybe it’s a thing in my life that I have been missing. I have my own issues with church and religion. I think maybe it’s time I look at those issues and see if they are something I should be able to resolve now in my later years.
