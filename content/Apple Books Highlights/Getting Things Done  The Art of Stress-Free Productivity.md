Do It, Delegate It, or Defer It Once you've decided on the next action, you have three options:1. | Do it. If an action will take less than two minutes, it should be done at the moment it is defined.2. | Delegate it. If the action will take longer than two minutes, ask yourself, Am I the right person to do this? If the answer is no, delegate it to the appropriate entity.3. | Defer it. If the action will take longer than two minutes, and you are the right person to do it, you will have to defer acting on it until later and track it on one or more "Next Actions" lists.
