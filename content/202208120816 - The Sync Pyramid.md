### As I have been thinking about this, I don’t think a pyramid is a **great** explanation. It’s more cubic in nature. More to follow. 

The sync pyramid is my ‘theory’ on best practices when it comes to leveraging  #sync  technology. 

Imagine a pyramid. At the top of the pyramid is your preferred #cloud provider. In my case, #iCloud.   Both arms of the triangle are equidistant. Terminating at each arm but at equidistant length are two devices. In my case an #iPhone and a #MacBook Air. It will/should/may look something like this:

Since #Obsidian utilizes markdown, I don’t **have** to use #Obsidian #sync but I want the ability to sync between multiple devices **and** multiple OS’s.
