YSK: MacOS saves a copy of everything you print forever. Here’s how to view the files.

Why YSK: you may not want your printed items to exist for all eternity.. but MacOS stores them. Here’s how to see.

THE EASY WAY

Using GUI (mouse and keyboard) Using finder go to  /var/spool/cups 

copy a item to desktop, rename the file extension to  .PDF 

THE NERD WAY

Open a terminal window. This can be found either through the “Application -> Utilities” folder

paste in

 sudo ls /var/spool/cups 

What is this doing? navigating to the folder “cups” and listing everything shown in terminal.

press enter. Are there files there? If so these are items you printed.

Here’s how to view them

Pick a file name. Now enter in

 sudo cp /var/spool/cups/FILENAME /Users/USERNAME/Desktop/FILENAME.pdf 

Note the space. USERNAME is the username of your machine, FILENAME is the file you picked from the terminal. Adding .PDF makes the new item which will pop up on your desktop a  .PDF  you can view. If you don’t know how to open a PDF watch this video

Open it. you will see exactly what was printed in the past! This is called CUPS Printer Job History.

DELETING THE FILES

To delete the files open  /var/spool/cups  in Finder and delete any items in that folder.

to protect the safety of your computer I’m not going to explain how to delete all files in the folder via terminal as it is too easy to make a mistake and wipe out other folders. If you’re using Nerd options you know the command.
