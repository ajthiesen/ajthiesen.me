1. In a large mixing bowl, cover chicken with layer of cholula, then rub
mixed spices all over it.
2. Sous vide chicken @ 160F for 1-1.5 hours and then dice chicken
afterward.
* OR cook chicken however you want and dice chicken.
3. Cook rice and pinto beans.
*(Optional) Season pinto beans with salt and pepper while boiling beans.
4. Assemble ingredients in tortillas, and wrap burritos.
5. Wrap burritos in foil and freeze extras. Thaw in fridge for 1-2 days
prior to eating. Reheat in microwave for about 2-3 minutes.

Notes:
* If you have never cooked raw pinto beans before, read the instructions
the night before. Soaking beans + cooking beans is easy, but it can take
hours.
* For all my recipes, I recommend you find your own preferences for
seasoning. I rarely put specific numbers since I personally eyeball it,
smell the mixture, and adjust as needed prior to cooking.
