Building a well architected personal network, entails a lot of factors. Thereâ€™s a lot of aspects that you need to consider beyond: *it just works*. 

Some considerations include:
- cost
- availability
- security
- use/misuse 
- privacy 
- integration

To name a few. These guides should **not** be treated as a tutorial. They should be treated as just that; a guide. Each individual guide focuses on things that work for **me**. What works for me, may not work for you.
