Section 306 of the Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices, Third Edition, (Compendium) explains that works by [[non-human authors]] will not be registered. The Compendium entry references two cases from the late 1800s: Trade-Mark Cases, 100 U.S. 82, 94 (1879) and Burrow-Giles Lithographic Co. v. Sarony, 111 U.S. 53, 58 (1884).
