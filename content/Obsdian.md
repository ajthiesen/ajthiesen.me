With [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), **your data sits in a local folder**. Never leave your life's work held hostage in the cloud again.

## FUTURE-PROOF FORMAT

Obsidian uses Markdown. Markdown is widely used by sites like Reddit and GitHub and not going away anytime soon.

Markdown is designed to be human readable. It's not obfuscated by encoding; you can directly edit the source files with Markdown editors, or edit them automatically with scripts.

 ## TOTAL CONTROL

Your notes live on your device, period. You can encrypt them or back them up however you want; it's your decision, not ours.

Plain text files let you do various sync, encryption, and data processing on top of it. Obsidian plays nice with Dropbox, Cryptomator, and any software that works with plain text files.
 
 ## ALWAYS AVAILABLE

No internet? No problem. Obsidian works completely offline, internet or service issues will never be your problem.

Enjoy reading and working on your notes anytime, anywhere.
