I know that #organizing is not my strong suit. I didnâ€™t realize how much #stuff I have floating around until I made a concerted effort to begging #cataloging, #classifying, and #organizing it all. I had stuff in #Evernote , Apple #notes , #OneNote, [[EagleFiler]] , and [[DevonThink Pro]]. 

The truly concerning thing isnâ€™t just the sheer amount of data, it the types of data that I had strewn across so many different platforms. #Invoices, #pay stubs , #PII, #PHI, to name just a few of the least flattering things. I also have legal #correspondence for business entities, bills, etc. 

Not only is it embarrassing, itâ€™s **worrying** frankly. I *know* how much stuff I have/had laying around and just living on who knows what servers. ðŸ™ƒ. Iâ€™m not *too* concerned, as my identity hasnâ€™t been stolen, yet. Now however, I realize how foolish I have been in willy-nilly letting things just collect and pile up. Being disorganized is for the birds!

Of course. I forgot about [[DayOne]] as well.
