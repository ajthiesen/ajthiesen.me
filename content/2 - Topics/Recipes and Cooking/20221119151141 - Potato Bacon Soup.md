INGREDIENTS:

3.5 cups chicken broth

4 russet potatoes, peeled and diced (3–4 cups)

1 (14 ounce) can diced tomatoes

1 yellow onion, diced

1 cup shredded carrots

1 cup diced celery

1 tablespoon dried parsley

1/2 tablespoon garlic powder

1 teaspoon dried basil

1 teaspoon salt

1/2 teaspoon black pepper

1 pound ground beef

1 package (12 ounces) bacon, cooked and chopped

3 tablespoons butter

1/4 cup flour (gluten free 1:1)

2 cups half and half

2 cups shredded cheddar cheese or pepper jack cheese

To garnish: green onions, reserved chopped bacon

INSTRUCTIONS:

Add the broth, tomatoes, potatoes, onions, carrots, celery, parsley, garlic powder, basil, salt and pepper to the slow cooker. Cover with the lid and cook on low for 6 to 8 hours, or on high for 3-4 hours

About 30 minutes prior to serving, brown the ground beef. Drain the grease and add it to the slow cooker. Fry and chop the bacon and transfer the chopped bacon to the slow cooker. You can also bake the bacon in the oven at any point while the soup is cooking and set it aside for later

Wipe out the pan of any excess grease and add in the butter. Melt the butter and then whisk in the flour until it’s all combined. Then whisk in the half and half. Continue whisking for about 2-3 minutes, until it’s thickened a bit

Pour the half and half into the slow cooker and stir to combine it in with the rest of the soup. Add the cheese and stir again. Cover and let the cheese melt for a few minutes. Give it another good stir or two to fully incorporate the cheese just prior to serving.
