Ingredients:

-   5 ancho chilies
-   5 guajillo chilies
-   4 pasilla chilies
-   4 mulato chilies
-   1/4 cup of sesame seeds
-   1/4 cup of pumpkin seeds
-   1/2 cup of almonds
-   1/2 cup of peanuts
-   4 cloves of garlic
-   1/2 an onion
-   4 cloves
-   4 allspice berries
-   1 cinnamon stick
-   1 teaspoon of dried oregano
-   1 teaspoon of dried thyme
-   1 teaspoon of dried marjoram
-   1/2 teaspoon of ground coriander
-   1/2 teaspoon of ground cumin
-   1/2 teaspoon of ground black pepper
-   1/4 teaspoon of ground cloves
-   2 tablespoons of lard or vegetable oil
-   1/2 cup of raisins
-   1/4 cup of Mexican chocolate
-   2 stale tortillas
-   8 cups of chicken or vegetable broth
-   Salt to taste

Instructions:

1.  Start by toasting the chilies in a dry skillet over medium heat until they become fragrant, about 1-2 minutes per side. Remove the stems and seeds from the chilies and soak them in hot water for about 30 minutes until they are soft.
    
2.  Toast the sesame seeds, pumpkin seeds, almonds, and peanuts in the same skillet until lightly browned, about 5-7 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.
    
3.  In a blender or food processor, puree the soaked chilies with the garlic, onion, cloves, allspice, cinnamon stick, oregano, thyme, marjoram, coriander, cumin, black pepper, and cloves until smooth. Add a little bit of the soaking liquid as needed to make a smooth paste.
    
4.  Heat the lard or vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the chili paste and cook for 15-20 minutes, stirring frequently, until the mixture has thickened and darkened in color.
    
5.  Add the raisins, chocolate, tortillas, and toasted nuts and seeds to the pot and stir until well combined.
    
6.  Gradually pour in the chicken or vegetable broth, stirring constantly, until the sauce reaches a smooth and silky consistency.
    
7.  Season with salt to taste and simmer for an additional 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has thickened and the flavors have melded together.
    
8.  Serve the mole negro over cooked chicken, turkey, or pork, garnished with sesame seeds and cilantro.
